Columbia Crest 2007 Stone Tree Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stone Tree Vineyard Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"This wine surprises by being so very pretty—unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through."
Adelsheim 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Adelsheim,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$19.0,Paul Gregutt,"A terrific value in a benchmark Oregon Pinot Gris, this is bright and refreshing, with the palate-cleansing minerality that characterizes all of the Adelsheim white wines. Jicama and melon and pear fruits mingle seamlessly, and the wine's texture and length are impressive."
Wagner 2011 Select Riesling (Finger Lakes),Wagner,Riesling,Select,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While off-dry in style, there's a savory apple tone throughout, accented by hints of lime zest and herb. The palate boasts juicy pink grapefruit flavor, along with a hint of lanolin that lingers on the finish."
Zerba Cellars 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Zerba Cellars,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"A strong scent and flavor of vitamin pill mixes with tight red fruit, stone, licorice and earth in this Rhône blend that includes small amounts of Grenache and Mourvèdre. Give this wine time to breathe and let the fruit come forward before you drink it."
Ventosa 2009 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Ventosa,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$17.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of petrol add complexity to lush honeycrisp apple and stone fruit notes on the nose and palate of this off-dry Riesling. Sleek and steely on the midpalate with an edgy lime juice acidity, and the finish is quite dry."
Frog's Leap 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Frog's Leap,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$30.0,,"A fine wine at the bottom of the ultrapremium price category. There's some bramble and forest aromas in advance of jammy cherry and blackberry fruit. Fades away smoothly and with good length. Not the most complex Cabernet, but it delivers the goods at all checkpoints."
Artesa 2012 Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Artesa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Limited Release,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$48.0,Virginie Boone,"Opaque and thick, this wine is robust, yet balanced—a study in cedar and pencil lead that drives into a dimension of dried herb. The savory components find companionship in fruitier notes of cherry and blueberry, before a tannic, oaky finish closes things out."
Red Newt Cellars 2012 Tango Oaks Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Riesling,Tango Oaks Vineyard,New York,Finger Lakes,US,91,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Perfumed and elegant, this wine is a highlight within the producer's line up of consistently well-made wines. Waxy honeycomb and floral aromas accent fresh green notes on this off-dry Riesling. It's lean in style, yet plush with sweet white peach and melon flavors. Finishes long with a lingering spray of honeysuckle."
Bloomer Creek 2008 Late Harvest Lot 1 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Bloomer Creek,Gewürztraminer,Late Harvest Lot 1,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$24.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"There's a dark, caramelized flair to the honeyed, off-dry palate on this amber gold Gewürz. Rich and full bodied in style, its slightly tinned lychee flavors, black tea astringency and spicy finish make for an unusual, contemplative wine."
Apolloni 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Apolloni,Chardonnay,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$17.0,Paul Gregutt,"There's a touch of sweetness around fruit flavors of apple, pear and melon. This has a forward, easy-drinking style, and that hint of honey finishes out with a streak of caramel."
Bergström 2009 Sigrid Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Bergström,Chardonnay,Sigrid,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,95,$80.0,Paul Gregutt,"An astonishing wine, creamy and loaded with lush fruit flavors. The tropical fruits are just the beginning; layer upon layer of marshmallow, whipped cream, brioche, butterscotch, buttered nuts, toast and more keep piling on. With all that richness, it remains a billowy, pillowy Chardonnay, light as a feather, yet deep and dreamy."
:Nota Bene 2013 Una Notte Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),:Nota Bene,Rhône-style Red Blend,Una Notte,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$30.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This combines 73% Grenache, 16% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre from Stone Tree, Arianses, Ciel du Cheval and Heart of the Hill vineyards. Its vanilla, pencil box, green herb, raspberry and purple fruit aromas are followed by quite sweet, ripe, full-bodied red and black fruit flavors. The balance seems off."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,Sauvignon Blanc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$11.0,Sean P. Sullivan,Light aromas of herbs and citrus lead to fleshy fruit flavors with a lightly spritzy feel. Pair it with baked chicken.
Avennia 2010 Sestina Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Avennia,Red Blend,Sestina,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,93,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"Sestina is the bigger sister to the winery's Gravura; again Cabernet Sauvignon takes front and center, with Merlot (18%) and Cabernet Franc (9%) filling in the rest. 70% of the French oak used was new, and the wine has more toast, smoke and barrel depth than its companion, though less of the luscious red fruit is showing. Espresso, cacao and other dark, roasted flavors wrap around black cherry cola and milk chocolate; the finish thoroughly delicious."
Ponzi 2012 Avellana Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Chardonnay,Avellana Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,93,$60.0,Paul Gregutt,"This Ponzi-owned vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA (but not listed as such). It's bright and tense, with coiled energy and flavors that do need some hours to breathe open. Poached pear, lemon curd and caramel apple are in the mix. At first a little hot in the finish, it smoothes out and turns into a buttery gem."
Saffron Fields Vineyard 2013 Heritage Clones Pinot Noir,Saffron Fields Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Heritage Clones,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"The heritage clones referenced here are Pommard and Wädenswil, yielding fresh and forward fruit flavors of strawberry with a cherry-popsickle kick. There's a nice brambly texture to the fruit, along with a dash of cola. It's a harmonious and texturally resonant Pinot Noir ready for near-term enjoyment."
Kokomo 2013 Peters Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Kokomo,Chardonnay,Peters Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$28.0,Virginie Boone,"Fully caramelized in oak, this wine shows flavors of ripe baked apple and pear within a full-bodied, concentrated style that's completely satisfying.

J Vineyards & Winery 2013 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),J Vineyards & Winery,Chardonnay,Estate Grown,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$28.0,Virginie Boone,"Full-bodied ripeness and creamy oak combine for a forceful white wine, rich and textured, made from a selection of two vineyard sites, including Bow Tie, a vineyard-designate. Toasty spice adds complexity before the wine finishes in caramel."
Dutton Estate 2009 Cohen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Dutton Estate,Sauvignon Blanc,Cohen Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$22.0,,"The wine is unoaked, but tastes strangely strong in vanilla and buttered toast. Whatever the aging regime, it's jammy in apricots, tangerines and mangoes that finish sweet and hot."
Ken Wright 2014 Bonnie Jean Vineyard Pinot Noir,Ken Wright,Pinot Noir,Bonnie Jean Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,94,$63.0,Paul Gregutt,"Deceptively light in color, yet aromatically rich, this sends up a lush mix of berries, spices, chocolate and pastry notes. It's youthful and vibrant, with clean, bright, tangy fruit that has the balance and power for excellent development in the bottle. Drink now through 2025."
Guzzling Goose 2008 Gewurztramajor,Guzzling Goose,Gewurztramajor,,Mars,N A,US,12,$324.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Lynmar 2014 Bliss Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Pinot Noir,Bliss Block,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$80.0,Virginie Boone,"Bliss Block lies within the property's Quail Hill Vineyard and is the coolest two acres on the estate. Spicy acidity and dark earth support a full-bodied, oaky imprint of complexity and structure, dotted in savory cranberry and black tea."
Doyenne 2006 Métier Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Doyenne,Red Blend,Métier Red Wine,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$36.0,Paul Gregutt,"Fruit compote—plum and strawberry—is melded to light toast and coffee. The wine has juicy acids and a thickly satisfying midpalate whose fruit flavors linger on, adding a little peppery spice as the wine evolves in the mouth. Just a whisp of chocolate leaves you ready for the next sip."
Heron Hill 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Heron Hill,Cabernet Franc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Hints of fresh herbs add depth to bright red-cherry and strawberry notes on this brisk, refreshing wine. Striking acidity and soft, delicate tannins draw out a long, cherry-menthol finish."
Raptor Ridge 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Raptor Ridge,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$38.0,Paul Gregutt,"A bit of a disappointment, given the excellence of the winery's 2010 vineyard designates. Tart cranberry fruit carries a whiff of saddle leather, and finishes with a fair amount of leafy herbal notes. It's sealed with screwcap, so decanting it would be a good idea if you plan to drink it soon."
Forgeron 2008 Orange Muscat (Columbia Valley (WA)),Forgeron,Orange Muscat,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$23.0,Paul Gregutt,"A fine complement to the Forgeron Late Harvest Sémillon, this is equally sweet (9.5%) but fortified to just under 18% alcohol. It's reminiscent of Benedictine & Brandy – orange liqueur with some alcohol power. Nice focus and balance."
Ken Wright 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Ken Wright,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths."
Rossi Wallace 2012 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),Rossi Wallace,Pinot Noir,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$28.0,,"This Pinot is consistent with the winery's previous bottlings over the years. It's a solid wine, with gentle tannins and tart acidity framing cranberry, cola and herb flavors. Drink now."
Castle Rock 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Castle Rock,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$11.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine offers aromas of herbs, black cherry and spice, showing a bit of heat. The dark-fruit flavors have good intensity, with dry, astringent tannins backing them up."
Apolloni 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Apolloni,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$32.0,Paul Gregutt,"A fine value in Oregon Pinot Noir, the estate bottling from Apolloni brings typical varietal flavors of sassafras, cherry cola and fresh herb. The fruit is perfectly ripe, yet retains the peppery, herbal, leafy character of northern Willamette Valley sites. Barrel aging adds length, texture and a finishing splash of butterfat."
Sterling 2004 Diamond Mountain Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Sterling,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Mountain Ranch Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$65.0,,"The most structured of Sterling's recent releases and hence our favorite, the 2004 Diamond Mountain Ranch Cabernet boasts notes of cinnamon, cassis and clove, framed by firm tannins and finishing with a hint of anise. Drink 2008–2015."
Waterbrook 2012 Rosé Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Waterbrook,Sangiovese,Rosé,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$11.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Pale salmon colored, this is a straightforward summer sipper with notes of cherry, watermelon, and wet stone. It drinks dry with a hint of effervescence and tart flavors."
Roadhouse Winery 2012 Gold Label Middle Reach Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Roadhouse Winery,Pinot Noir,Gold Label Middle Reach,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$52.0,,"A blend of several vineyards in the famous Middle Reach stretch of the warmer, northwestern arm of the Russian River Valley, this is a beautiful wine to drink now. It's dry and silky, with perfectly ripened raspberry, cherry, strawberry and cola flavors, brightened by crisp acidity. It will hold in the bottle through 2020."
Emerson 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Emerson,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"There's a light whiff of nail polish remover here, and little evidence of ripe fruit. Some flavors of stem come up with the tannins, and overall this is a wine best drunk soon."
Williams Selyem 2006 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Allen Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$78.0,,"The Allen bottling typically needs time to come around. This '06 shows the dusty tannins that close it down a bit in its youth, suggesting a good five years in the cellar. Silky and refined, it should evolve to a fine wine, with its cherry pie, mocha, cola and spice flavors. If you drink now, decant. Beautiful with a fine grilled steak."
Merry Edwards 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$48.0,Virginie Boone,"A blend from several of the producer's finest vineyards, including Georganne, Flax, Olivet Lane and Klopp, this offers complex notes of smoky lavender and licorice.

Illahe 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Illahe,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"The reserve spends 18 months in 50% new French oak. It's already drinking well and hinting at quickly-maturing tannins. Soft and lightly leathery, it mixes rose petals, milk chocolate and sandalwood in with the pretty cherry fruit. Drink now and over the next few years."
Buehler 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Buehler,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$36.0,Virginie Boone,"Soft and juicy in black cherry and plum, this wine offers good value in its blend of girth and acidity. It piques interest on the palate with its toned black licorice and velvety structure."

Iijima,"Equal proportions of Cabernet Franc and Merlot yield this penetrating sour-cherry palate touched with nuts, smoke, bramble and herb.

Red Newt Cellars 2014 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Riesling,Semi-Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While subdued on the nose, crunchy Asian pear and green-apple flavors on the palate are persistent and vital. Racy acidity and delicate sweetness balance neatly. A refreshing, thirst quenching wine with wide appeal."
Provincial Vineyards 2012 Reserve Rêve Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Provincial Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Reserve Rêve Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"One barrel was new French oak, the other neutral. The cranberry fruit here is subdued and tart, while the barrel aging brings in popcorn, walnuts and even a trace of butter brickle. Give this bottle until 2017–2017 to open up."
Walter Dacon 2008 Skookum Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Walter Dacon,Red Blend,Skookum,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,83,$20.0,Paul Gregutt,"Kool-aid character, light raspberry fruit, slightly candied, with an artificial tang to the finish."
Golden Leopard 2007 Sake,Golden Leopard,Sake,,Australia,NA,US,81,$383.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Fritz 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Fritz,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$30.0,,"For some reason, Fritz held this wine back eight months later than their very fine 2009 Reserve Pinot. It's a solid wine, silky and pure, but it's a little too sweet in raspberries and cherries, like a granola candy bar."
Red Newt Cellars 2011 Circle Riesling (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Riesling,Circle,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$12.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Exotic melon and pineapple flavors are accented by hints of chalk and powdered sugar on this brisk yet penetrating Riesling.

Juicy blackberry and plum combine with dusty, integrated tannin, as a length of dark cherry and sage weave in and out."
Robert Weil 2016 Soju,Robert Weil,Soju,,Australia,N A,US,196,$215.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Made by Alan Viader of the Viader winemaking family in the Napa Valley, it shows power and grace in equal measure."
Cor Cellars 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cor Cellars,Riesling,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"This off-dry (11.5% alcohol) Riesling is a fruit-driven wine, with a tangy sweet/tart mouthfeel reminiscent of Vouvray. Meyer lemon, apricot, lime and candied pineapple flavors pile on. There's plenty of natural acid to cut through the sweetness."
Novelty Hill 2006 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Novelty Hill,Sauvignon Blanc,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,92,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc. Here is the same mix of racy, bracing tropical and stone fruit flavors, nicely matched to toasty flavors of almonds and biscuits. Elegant, detailed and ripe, yet clearly varietal, this is a beautiful, seductive example of barrel-fermented Washington Sauvignon Blanc."
Hill Wine Company 2011 Black Dog Series Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Hill Wine Company,Chardonnay,Black Dog Series,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$18.0,,"Its brisk acidity and dry, tart lemon-and-lime flavors make this a nice wine to drink now. It has the herb and tobacco notes you often find in Napa Valley Chardonnay."
Secret House 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Secret House,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,84,$22.0,Michael Schachner,"Some youthful minty cherry marks the nose. The palate is heavy on the tangy red fruits: cranberry and raspberry. A clean quaffer and a nice introduction to the world of Oregon Pinot. Has the varietal correctness, but it’s trim as a stick."
Browne Family Vineyards 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Browne Family Vineyards,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$30.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"The oak—all French—is out front with notes of toast, crème brûlée and spice along with peach and lemon. It's light in style with a warm finish."

It's been aged almost two years in new French oak barrels, and has the delicious mix of fruit and barrel flavors to prove it.

Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Dutton-Goldfield,Chardonnay,Dutton Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$38.0,Virginie Boone,"This golden wine confounds in a mix of wet stone and caramel on the nose, the body creamy in vanilla. Fuller in style and body than some, it remains balanced in acidity and tangy citrus, maintaining a freshness and brightness throughout. The finish is intense with more of that citrus, plus an accent of ginger and lemongrass."
Amici 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Amici,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reserve,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$80.0,Virginie Boone,"Floral and lush, this majority Cabernet Sauvignon contains 10% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, combining for a structured, layered wine accented in black cherry, cedar and dried herb.

Origin 2014 Johan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Origin,Pinot Noir,Johan Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$60.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is showing a bit of muscle, and some still-integrating barrel flavors, but it's already a wine that delivers plenty of pleasure. Forgive the flaky faux-wax topping (not thick enough to be called a real capsule) and enjoy the well-ripened blackberry fruit, the nicely-layered creamy chocolate, the touch of underbrush and the appealing length. Drink now through 2022."
Starmont 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Starmont,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$27.0,,"Pretty good price for a Cabernet this elegant and rich. Starmont is a kind of second label to the excellent producer, Merryvale, and this '07 shows a fine pedigree, as well as the general quality of the vintage. It's dry and balanced, with complex blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Drink now–2013."

The fruit flavors are pure and focused, and the wine opens beautifully with tangy boysenberry, plum and wild cherry. The acids carry it aloft, and the tannins, just slightly hinting at green tea, are polished and firm. Though it finishes with some herbal flavors, it is satisfying throughout."
WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Aliette Pinot Noir,WillaKenzie Estate,Pinot Noir,Aliette,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$48.0,Paul Gregutt,"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025."

Michelle,Meritage,Artist Series Red,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$55.0,Paul Gregutt,"Smooth and supple, this five-grape Bordeaux-style blend is almost two thirds Canoe Ridge estate fruit from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, the rest Cold Creek Vineyard Merlot.

Bennett Lane 2016 Maximus White Feasting Wine White (Napa Valley),Bennett Lane,White Blend,Maximus White Feasting Wine,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$36.0,Virginie Boone,"This blend of 89% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Chardonnay and 1% Muscat is fulsome, lush and rounded, with deep layers of pear, fig and vanilla flavors.

Left Coast Cellars 2012 Orchards Reserve Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Left Coast Cellars,Pinot Gris,Orchards Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"This very limited production reserve was fermented and aged sur lie in a concrete egg. Egg-zactly what that did for the flavor remains a mystery. It conveys crisp flavors of green berry, green apple and pear."
Columbia Crest 2005 Two Vines Shiraz (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Shiraz,Two Vines,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,84,$8.0,Paul Gregutt,"Straightforward, this offers thin, tart fruit with excessive vanilla and tobacco flavors. There's no residual sugar, but otherwise it's right out of the Australian playbook."
Northwest Totem Cellars 2006 Potlatch Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Northwest Totem Cellars,Red Blend,Potlatch Red,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,84,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"A light, fruity, high-acid wine with strawberry flavors and a hint of leaf and herb."
Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Chateau Lafayette Reneau,Cabernet Sauvignon,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Swathes of fresh tarragon lend a green, herbal tone to cassis and black plum flavors in this pretty wine. Penetrating, grippy tannins are jolting on the finish, underlining a tight, brisk finish."
Glenora 2011 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Glenora,Gewürztraminer,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Classic Gewürztraminer from start to finish, this luxuriously off-dry sipper bursts with heady rose petal and ripe, rich lychee notes. Zesty and bright with acidity, the finish is marked by delicious hints of lanolin and lime zest."
Miner 2014 Wild Yeast Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Miner,Chardonnay,Wild Yeast,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"Thickly concentrated, this wine offers a wealth of crème brûléee richness and complexity, dotted in golden honey and a twist of lime. Supple and medium in build, it integrates the oak and ripeness at its core, finishing with a brightness of acidity that refreshes."
Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Méthode Champenoise Brut  (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Champagne Blend,Méthode Champenoise Brut,New York,Finger Lakes,US,91,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Saline and mineral tones accent fresh apple, pear and lemon in this zippy, invigorating sparkling wine. Made in a Chardonnay-based traditional-method style, its delicate pétillance and whiffs of caramelized sugar and brioche are enticing."
Groth 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Groth,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$19.0,,"Pretty good price for a bone-dry, crisply elegant Sauvignon Blanc with such good flavor. It's citrusy in limes and grapefruits, with richer notes of figs and melons, and finishes with a scour of spice."
Wilridge 2009 Estate Syrah-Mourvèdre Syrah-Mourvèdre (Columbia Valley (WA)),Wilridge,Syrah-Mourvèdre,Estate Syrah-Mourvèdre,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$29.0,Paul Gregutt,"More than three quarters Syrah, this is made from young vines planted in the estate vineyard in the extreme western Yakima Valley. With such new vines it is difficult to point to specific varietal character. It's tart and lightly fruity, with a pleasant spicy edge."
Glenora 2009 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Glenora,Chardonnay,Barrel Fermented,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Honeydew melon and a touch of cream on the midpalate of this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay add a hint of luxury. Lightly toasted oak notes are pleasantly balanced along with a fresh, clean acidity."
Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Mancini Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Joseph Swan Vineyards,Zinfandel,Mancini Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$28.0,,"This Zinfandel's tannins are starting to resolve, which gives the palate a soft, melted quality. The primary flavors are transforming into rich, dried black-raspberry and cherry notes, with leather, mocha, dried mushroom and spice accents."
Hunt & Ryde 2014 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Hunt & Ryde,Pinot Noir,Estate Grown,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"In its second vintage, this wine is light and spicy, clearly made to be enjoyed with food. A collaborative effort between winemaker Guy Davis and proprietor/grapegrower and chef Guy Fieri, it shines in subtly toasty oak, cinnamon and dark cherry flavors, with a lingering lushness on the finish."
Janzen 2008 Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Janzen,Cabernet Sauvignon,Missouri Hopper Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$100.0,,"A wine to cellar. With powerful tannins and near perfect balance, it's extraordinarily ripe and rich in blackberries and currants, with hints of minerals and spices. Very dry, it feels vital from the first taste to the long finish. The vineyard is north of Yountville, which puts it in a cooler area. Should develop bottle complexity over the next decade."
Rally Point Wines 2013 Limited Production Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Rally Point Wines,Chardonnay,Limited Production,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$38.0,Virginie Boone,"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume."
WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Aliette Pinot Noir,WillaKenzie Estate,Pinot Noir,Aliette,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,94,$55.0,Paul Gregutt,"From the oldest part of the estate, planted in 1992, this excellent effort seems to have entered the phase where more aromatic complexity appears. It has lovely delineation of both scents and flavors, a matrix of fruit, soil and Pommard clone. Strong streaks of tobacco and chocolate annotate the core of raspberry puree. The concentration and length are impressive."
Roco 2011 Clawson Creek Vineyards Pinot Noir,Roco,Pinot Noir,Clawson Creek Vineyards,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"Cola, earth, iron and spice flavors rise prominently on this Pinot Noir. The fruit remains secondary, but it's a detailed, tasty effort with appealing minerality."

Sheldrake Point 2006 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Sheldrake Point,Cabernet Franc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,82,$17.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"This Cabernet Franc has a slightly watery, sweet fruit element that lacks the cheerful vibrancy and pluckiness of the variety. On the nose, it offers soft red fruit and some spice, but the flavors feel weak. Not a bad wine overall, but needs some muscle."
240 Days 2015 Riesling (Finger Lakes),240 Days,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$28.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Waxy citrus skins and pressed apple notes are accented by a whiff of pine in this racy light-footed Riesling. It's just a shade off dry, with an invigoratingly brisk texture. Drink now through 2019."
Dr. Franzl Lang 2012 Merlotte,Dr. Franzl Lang,Merlotte,,Mars,NA,US,117,$16.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Red Tail Ridge 2013 Barrel Fermented RTR Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Red Tail Ridge,Chardonnay,Barrel Fermented RTR Estate Vineyard,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A combination of American and Hungarian oak lends sultry spice, smoke and herb tones to this elegant wine. Freshly pressed apple and pear flavors are a touch savory on the palate, but the wine finishes brisk and bright."
Red Newt Cellars 2007 Syrah-Cabernet Franc Red (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Red Blend,Syrah-Cabernet Franc,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$25.0,,"Aromas of tomato leaf and blackberry unfold into flavors of pepper and cherry cola. Vanilla aromas dominate the long, crisp finish, which shows nicely refined tannins."
Standing Stone 2008 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Gewürztraminer,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$19.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Concentrated aromas of lychee, rose petals and black tea leaves perfume this delicious golden yellow wine. The palate is dry, but with just a touch of pink grapefruit softness. Although full and rich in the mouth, balanced acidity and a spiced, grapefruit pith finish keeps the wine from getting flabby."
Buoncristiani 2008 O.P.C. 10th Anniversary Red (Napa Valley),Buoncristiani,Red Blend,O.P.C. 10th Anniversary,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$48.0,,"This wine earns a high score for sheer extravagance. It's soft, velvety and sweet-tasting, boasting chocolate, cherry, currant, cassis, bacon and smoky oak flavors. High alcohol makes it feel a little warm, but that's the price you pay for such ripeness. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, it will pair beautifully with barbecue."
Lost and Found Winery 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lost and Found Winery,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$49.0,Virginie Boone,"A project of Master Sommelier Geoff Kruth with the assistance of winemaker Megan Glaab of Ryme Cellars, this is a light beguiling take on the famous appellation's most famous variety—one wrapped in crisp crunchy red fruit and floral aromatics of rose. Dried cherry highlights tight focused acidity and soft delicate layers of silky texture for a satisfying combination of elegance and quiet oak."
Davis Family 2011 Starr Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Davis Family,Pinot Noir,Starr Ridge Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,86,$50.0,,"The vineyard is in a theoretically warmer part of the valley, in the Windsor region, but somehow, there are unripe notes here. Despite some sour-cherry candy and pomegranate flavors, there's a green streak of asparagus. Drink the wine soon, as it's not an ager."
DaMa 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),DaMa,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$21.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"A blend of revered Sagemoor and Conner Lee vineyards, this barrel-fermented wine has aromas of caramel, poached pear, lees and peach. The stone fruit flavors are light yet creamy in feel, trailing toward the finish."
Dry Creek Vineyard 2012 DCV Estate Block 10 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Dry Creek Vineyard,Chardonnay,DCV Estate Block 10,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$30.0,Virginie Boone,"The winery once made 30,000 cases of Chardonnay. With this release, it micro-sized that number down to 1,250, focusing on 30 vine rows to make a better wine. Mission accomplished—this medium-bodied wine offers a creamy texture, with concentrated fig and pear flavors around a mineral-laden finish."
Cave B 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cave B,Riesling,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"Stainless steel fermentation has yielded a yeasty, beery wine. There's plenty of fruit, a bit too reminiscent of canned peaches, and a finish that seems constricted and short. Residual sugar is right around 2%."
Atwater 2013 Big Blend Red (Finger Lakes),Atwater,Red Blend,Big Blend,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This Syrah-based blend of five different red grapes may be “big” in blending components, but it's quite sleek and elegant on the palate. It's not a deeply concentrated brooding wine, but brisk and spry, offering fresh black-cherry and berry flavors. Soft feathery tannins and notes of cedar and forest floor linger on the finish."
Graton Ridge 2010 Bacigalupi Vineyards Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Graton Ridge,Zinfandel,Bacigalupi Vineyards,California,Russian River Valley,US,84,$48.0,,"Tastes almost as sweet and fruity as a minor Port, with milk chocolate, raisin and molasses flavors. It's a bit soft and warm."
Billhook 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Billhook,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$30.0,,"What a nice wine for drinking now and over the next few years. At the age of nearly four, it's mellow and rich, with the blackberry fruit and oak flavors achieving a savory marriage. Finishes dry, spicy and tart."
Mosquito Fleet 2010 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Mosquito Fleet,Cabernet Franc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$29.0,Paul Gregutt,"Fragrant and detailed, this pure Cabernet Franc mixes dried berries and herbs, hints of tar and tobacco, along with well-managed tannins. Everything resolves in a long and lissome finish."
Peju 2005 Fifty/Fifty Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),Peju,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Fifty/Fifty Red Wine,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$85.0,,"Equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is very delicious and very young. It combines ripe, plush cassis and cocoa fruit flavor with rich, fine tannins and fine acidity to produce a wine of extraordinary balance. Should develop effortlessly over the next decade."
Hogue 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Hogue,Riesling,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$11.0,Paul Gregutt,"Lightly off dry, this graceful and beautifully balanced wine blends in about 7% Gewürztraminer, elevating the aromatics. Key lime, pink grapefruit and a touch of lemon zest are in play, with a finish that recalls a sip of English breakfast tea."
Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Soft, sunny acidity and luscious mouthfeel give this Chardonnay an overall plushness. The palate is marked by creamy peach and apple flavors accented by delicate wisps of vanilla and spice. While straightforward in style, it's supple and pleasing."
Vercingetorix VX 2014 Reserve Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Vercingetorix VX,Pinot Noir,Reserve Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"This reserve offers rather light strawberry fruit, and some highlights of tobacco and milk chocolate. It spent 18 months in one-third new French oak. Despite the reserve tag and the excellent vintage, it comes across as simple and a bit dilute."
William Church 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),William Church,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$38.0,Paul Gregutt,"A warm year ripens the fruit well at this cool climate site; so well that it's just on the edge of raisiny. There are mixed flavors of Bourbon-soaked raisins, plum pudding and coffee liqueur; the barrels show more strongly than the fruit, at least for now."
Atwater 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Atwater,Cabernet Sauvignon,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"There's an abundance of crisp black cherry and cassis flavors in this Cabernet Sauvignon, but hints of green leaves and wet soil lend a dark, elegant tone. Quite supple and full on the palate, it finishes long with staunch, grippy tannins."
Adler Fels 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Russian River Valley),Adler Fels,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Russian River Valley,US,83,$25.0,,"An okay red wine. It's soft, dry and common in structure, with thin flavors of blackberries, spices and a touch of oak."
Six Mile Creek 2010 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Six Mile Creek,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Scents of lemon zest, underripe pineapple and white flower abound on this dry, surprisingly-lean Chardonnay, with hints of sweet cream and vanilla. Brisk with crisp apple flavor, it finishes clean with just a hint of salinity."
Mason Cellars 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Mason Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$16.0,,"This is dry, acidic and a little underripe, with a New Zealand-like touch of gooseberry. A respectable wine, this has a bright core of lemon, lime and tropical fruit."
Furious George 2017 Data Join,Furious George,Data Join,,New York,NA,US,1,$215.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Apolloni 2007 Olivia Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Apolloni,Pinot Noir,Olivia Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$32.0,Paul Gregutt,"A hard, tannic wine, this shows concentrated raspberry fruit flavors, but does not have the fullness and texture of this winery's 2006 releases. Perhaps it's the vintage character, or maybe the wines were somehow stripped during vinification. Give it lots of aeration."
Fox Run 2013 Lemberger (Finger Lakes),Fox Run,Lemberger,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$21.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ripe blackberry and cassis notes seem glazed with bluebery jam in this rippling but light-footed Lemberger. It doesn't exhibit the grape variety's characteristic staunchness of acidity and tannins, but a refreshing squirt of sour-cherry acidity brightens the midpalate. Drink now through 2018."
Girard 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Girard,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$24.0,,"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple marmalade, lemon custard, vanilla and smoky meringue flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.9%."
Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Intense stone-fruit and honeysuckle notes merge seamlessly with hints of smoke and crushed stone. While ripe and rich, it's also penetratingly dry, with juicy fruit flavors. It's gorgeously composed with striking lime-juice acidity and a savory, minerally tone that lingers."
Blinking Lizard 2016 Pinot Vert,Blinking Lizard,Pinot Vert,,Washingtonne,,US,190,$186.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Red Tail Ridge 2011 Barrel Fermented RTR Vineyard Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Red Tail Ridge,Chardonnay,Barrel Fermented RTR Vineyard,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Aromatic of sweet cream, ripe apple and buttered popcorn, this luxurious Chardonnay counters richness of flavor with brisk acidity and impeccably balanced alcohol. It's irresistibly luscious but elegant."
Apolloni 2015 L Cuvée Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Apolloni,Chardonnay,L Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$28.0,Paul Gregutt,"The cuvée is barrel fermented, for roundness rather than strong oak flavors. Spicy apple and melon fruit comes with the lightest possible kiss of toast."
J Vineyards & Winery 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),J Vineyards & Winery,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$35.0,,"Pretty and polished, an elegant, lighter style Pinot Noir to drink now with rich pork, lamb and beef dishes or grilled salmon. It's silky and satiny, with pleasant wild strawberry, cherry, red currant, licorice, cola and cedar flavors."
Toad Hollow 2010 Goldie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Toad Hollow,Pinot Noir,Goldie's Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,86,$17.0,,"A fairly lean Pinot, this lacks voluptuousness, but it's dry and crisp, with fine cherry, cranberry, tobacco and pepper flavors. Give it some airing and drink now."
N. Kendall Wines 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes),N. Kendall Wines,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,91,$35.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend earthy complexity to tart lemon, tangerine and sugar cookie notes on the nose of this feather-light Riesling. It's gossamer in texture yet full of juicy sweet pink-grapefruit flavor. High-toned acidity drives a cutting finish marked by a pleasantly bitter ring of lime pith and hazelnut skins."
Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2011 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$12.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Intensely tropical on the nose and palate, this off-dry Riesling shines with notes of juicy melon, papaya and peach candy, with a hint of white, waxy flower for extra flair. Brisk acidity keeps all that fruity sweetness in check, leading to a sleek, steely finish."
Gamache 2014 Estate Grown Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Gamache,Riesling,Estate Grown,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$15.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Pear, almond and toast aromas lead to dry, elegant fruit and lees flavors. It's a uniquely styled offering of the variety."
Coelho 2014 Apreciação Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Coelho,Chardonnay,Apreciação Estate Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula."
Brigadoon 2014 Lylee Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Brigadoon,Pinot Noir,Lylee,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$23.0,Paul Gregutt,"The first release annually from the estate vineyard, this is a solid effort, seemingly infused with scents and flavors of pine needle, pine tar, earth and bark. The fruit is in the background, and leans toward cranberry and brambly blackberry."
Hourglass 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Hourglass,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$155.0,,"High alcohol is giving this 100% Cabernet some inherent instability that warrants against extended aging. However, if you drink it soon, you'll find a vastly rich, opulent wine, with blackberry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors whose tannins reflect Napa's best. A fabulous steak, perfectly charred and prepared, will make you drain the bottle."
Résonance 2014 Résonance Vineyard Pinot Noir,Résonance,Pinot Noir,Résonance Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,94,$65.0,Paul Gregutt,"This exceptional vineyard, more than 35-years-old, brings a wealth of subtle details to a wine that has both grace and power. There's truffle, earth, mocha, plum, spice, coffee and on and on it goes, all well integrated already. Experience would suggest that wines from this vineyard, previously made for Sineann, are exceptionally ageworthy. Drink now if you must, or cellar and drink from 2022 to 2030."
Columbia Crest 2007 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Chardonnay,Grand Estates,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$11.0,Paul Gregutt,"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong."
Red Newt Cellars 2013 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Riesling,Semi-Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fresh green sage and tarragon notes lend an herbaceous freshness to this elegant off-dry Riesling.

Chasing Venus 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Chasing Venus,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$16.0,Virginie Boone,"Ripe sweet tropical pineapple and guava mark this wine as does a sway of wild grass, the wine otherwise perfectly crisp and clean."
B Cellars 2015 Blend 27 Red (Napa Valley),B Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blend 27,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$79.0,Virginie Boone,"Merlot makes up 40% of this blend, with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Petit Verdot and 6% Cabernet Franc as well. Smoky meaty characteristics ride a rounded, smoothly textured and full-bodied explosion of baked blackberry and cassis, the tannins chalky."
Columbia Crest 2015 Grand Estates Unoaked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Chardonnay,Grand Estates Unoaked,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,Light aromas of apple and pear lead to broad dry flavors. It delivers easy-drinking appeal.

Blackbird Vineyards 2011 Contrarian Red (Napa Valley),Blackbird Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Contrarian,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$125.0,,"Sweet cherry, red licorice, violet, cocoa and new oak flavors make this wine drinkable now despite firm tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon's role is relatively muted, with Cab Franc taking a starring role, and Merlot also a strong component of the blend. The window of drinkability extends at least through 2019."
Titus 2006 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Titus,Zinfandel,,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$27.0,,"A beautiful Zinfandel, softly tannic and lush, and showing how Napa Valley dominates the variety when it comes to balance and elegance. The ultra-refined tannins frame flavors of berry jam, currants, mocha, licorice and pepper. This is really a superior Zinfandel."
Hunnicutt 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Hunnicutt,Chardonnay,,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$45.0,,"A rich, ripe Chardonnay, made to appeal to the popular style. Shows tons of pineapple, peach, green apple, buttered toast, cream and honey flavors, balanced with crisp acidity."
Roco 2011 Private Stash #9 Pinot Noir,Roco,Pinot Noir,Private Stash #9,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$70.0,Paul Gregutt,"Burgundian in every way, this deceptively light (in color, alcohol and impact) wine rewards your attention with its finesse and complexity. Rhubarb, pomegranate, peppermint, earth and savory herbs are all highlights, and the length is equally impressive. It's low in alcohol, but high in aging potential."
Lamoreaux Landing 2007 Estate Bottled Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,Chardonnay,Estate Bottled Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$20.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice.

Standing Stone 2012 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Exuberant floral notes lend a perfumy touch to fresh apple and pear aromas on this dry, medium-bodied wine.

Pope Valley Winery 2012 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Pope Valley Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate Reserve,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$68.0,Virginie Boone,"Thick in decadent tannin accents and integrated oak, this wine also offers high-toned cassis and cranberry, with a touch of cedar lurking in the shadows. It finishes in a wash of leather and black pepper."
Omero 2012 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Omero,Chardonnay,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$38.0,Paul Gregutt,"Ripe flavors suggest vanilla banana custard, along with sweet apple and smooth caramel. Some time spent in French oak brings up a finish with highlights of toasted nuts."
Lionheart 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Lionheart,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$55.0,,"Here's a smooth, polished and rewarding Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the structure and finesse you expect from Napa Valley, and is not one of those modern fruit bombs despite rich flavors of blackberries, currants and cassis. Good now and through 2010, at least."

Sullivan,"The winery's flagship offering, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Cabernet Franc (25%) and Malbec. It opens with high-toned aromas of herbs and dark coffee that are followed by plush fruit flavors that taper toward the finish."
Anthony Road 2006 No Oak Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Anthony Road,Chardonnay,No Oak,New York,Finger Lakes,US,83,$12.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"A subtle nose of butter and spice leads this wine whose flavors are varietally correct but not terribly inspired. The fruit is balanced and round but the finish slightly watery. Not a bad everyday sip, but needs complexity."
The Ghost in the Machine 2011 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),The Ghost in the Machine,Riesling,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$7.0,Paul Gregutt,"How do you make a Riesling this good and sell it for seven bucks?

Lamoreaux Landing 2014 Red Oak Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,Riesling,Red Oak Vineyard,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Dusty mineral, smoke and struck flint lend a savory tone to this lean light-bodied Riesling. Off dry in style, the palate offers delicately concentrated flavors of red apple and nectarine off set by tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2021."
Merry Edwards 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$32.0,,"High-toned gooseberry, pear, papaya and fig flavors mark this dry, but creamy Sauvignon Blanc. It's rich with fruit, yet dry on the finish with brisk acidity."
Siduri 2011 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Siduri,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"Winemaker Adam Lee notes that only two Oregon Pinots were made in 2011, as all fruit was declassified. Indeed, this is a thin, peppery wine, with highlights of orange peel and grapefruit, and just a short slice of red berry fruit."
Robert Weil 2020 Kirsch,Robert Weil,Kirsch,,New York,,US,97,$153.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
D.R. Stephens 2014 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),D.R. Stephens,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$85.0,Virginie Boone,"Fleshy, dense and bright with cassis and vanilla notes, this 100% varietal estate wine is lovely and elegantly restrained, showing compact oak and firm tannin. Raspberry, tobacco and cedar round out the nuanced flavors that open over time."
Stottle 2008 Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA)),Stottle,Barbera,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$26.0,Paul Gregutt,"Solidly varietal flavors of strawberry and Bing cherry fruit anchor this well-made, 100% Barbera. The wine has both depth and polish, with some varietal tartness running through a medium length finish. It makes a good case for Barbera's potential in Washington state."
Dutton Estate 2010 Dutton Palms Vineyard Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Dutton Estate,Chardonnay,Dutton Palms Vineyard Dutton Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$40.0,,"The vineyard is in the coolest part of the Green Valley of the Russian River Valley. The wine, which is totally dry, is marked by brilliant acidity and long hangtime flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruit, enriched by barrel fermentation and aging."
McGregor 2010 Black Russian Red (Finger Lakes),McGregor,Red Blend,Black Russian,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$55.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of ripe black cherries, vanilla and spice, along with delicate hints of soil and barnyard, mark this unusual blend of Saperavi and Sereksiya grapes. Tart black-fruit flavors accented with swathes of fresh herbs are a bit lean on the palate, but the acidity is gentle. It's dry and easy drinking in style with smooth, gentle tannins."
Lynmar 2010 Monastery Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Chardonnay,Monastery,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$70.0,,"Lots of toasty new oak marks this Chardonnay, as well as bright, citrusy acidity. It's young, vibrant and energetic, and undoubtedly complex. Beginning with flavors of Meyer lemons, apricots and limes, it evolves in the glass with flavors of minerals, white flowers and honey. This should last six years or so."
Brogan 2007 Buena Prierra Vineyard Helio Doro Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Brogan,Pinot Noir,Buena Prierra Vineyard Helio Doro Block,California,Russian River Valley,US,95,$90.0,,"So dry, so crisply acidic, so silky in the mouth, and so rich in flavor. This is a truly distinctive Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's elusive personality, now rich in cherries and currants, withdrawing into minerals and herbs. Yet the final impression is of fine, silky decadence. Should develop in fascinating directions over the next 6–8 years."
Damiani 2006 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barrel Select,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$35.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"This wine has the kind of beefy, muscular character that one expects in a Cab, with its earthy berry and leathery spice nose, and a layering of tobacco smoke, black pepper and rich berry on the palate. Decent tannins and minerality add to the weight. A good wine with ageable appeal."
Dr. Konstantin Frank 2016 Dry Rosé of Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Pinot Noir,Dry Rosé of,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ripe luscious aromas of fleshy red plum and cherries turn a bit more demure on the palate of this Pinot Noir rosé. It's a full bodied wine with yielding acidity and pleasant heft on the palate. A touch of minerality lends elegance to the finish.
Arbor Crest 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Arbor Crest,Sauvignon Blanc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$11.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is Bacchus vineyard fruit, as per normal – these vines are something like 35 years old. It's all stainless-steel fermented, aged on the lees and finished at 13% alcohol. Fruit flavors of peach and pineapple fill the mouth with round, lightly spicy flavors. It's ripe but not sweet, tart but not too citrusy. Good balance and texture through the finish."
Troll Bridge 2010 Password Red (Napa Valley),Troll Bridge,Red Blend,Password,California,Napa Valley,US,85,$75.0,Virginie Boone,"Herbal and excessive in wood tannins, this has strong elements of jalapeño and pepper amidst a full-bodied expression of black plum and chocolate."
Fulkerson 2010 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Fulkerson,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Zesty aromas of fresh lemon and tangerine peel add vibrancy to this brisk, dry Riesling. It's elegant and fruity, and it offers loads of crisp green-apple and pear flavors that are accented by dusty minerality. A hint of lime-skin astringency surfaces on the finish."
Kenwood 2010 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),Kenwood,Pinot Gris,,California,Russian River Valley,US,86,$16.0,,"Clean and vibrant in the mouth, with zesty acidity and brisk flavors of tangerines, Meyer lemons, honey and vanilla. Nice as a cocktail sipper to get the evening started."
J. Bookwalter 2013 Protagonist Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),J. Bookwalter,Cabernet Sauvignon,Protagonist,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$60.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 95% of this wine, with the balance Syrah. It seems reductive out of the gate, making it a challenge to get at the black-cherry aromas. The dark fruit, fig and herb flavors are full in feel, seeming slightly dried out and backed by surprisingly soft tannins for the variety."
Billsboro 2014 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Cabernet-Syrah (Finger Lakes),Billsboro,Cabernet-Syrah,Sawmill Creek Vineyards,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$28.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Savory slightly rustic tones of forest floor and bramble lend complexity to this elegant blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Peppery spice and dried herb flavors meld into tart red cherry and plum on the palate. It's rich in body yet balanced neatly with a taut frame of acidity and fine persistent tannins. Drink now through 2021.
Dr. Franzl Lang 2004 Kirsch,Dr. Franzl Lang,Kirsch,,France,N A,US,210,$287.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Frank Family 2011 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Frank Family,Zinfandel,,California,Napa Valley,US,85,$37.0,,"This is a good Zin, with raspberry, red currant and licorice flavors. Minty green notes alongside bright fruit lend a slightly unripe or uneven feel. Drink up."
Burgess 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Burgess,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$30.0,,"Simple, easy and balanced, this crowd-pleasing Cab will satisfy for its wealth of ripe fruit and oak flavors. Floods the mouth with cassis, licorice and melted milk chocolate, wrapped in smooth, gentle tannins."
Pine Ridge 2010 FORTIS Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Pine Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,FORTIS,California,Napa Valley,US,94,$150.0,,"If you're looking for classic Napa Cabernet, this utterly delicious bottling is right there. Blended with some Petit Verdot and Merlot, it's a selection of the winery's extensive acreage across the Stags Leap, Rutherford, Carneros and Oakville appellations, showcasing the synergy of blending. The wine is dry, full-bodied, firm in tannins and extraordinarily lush, with blackberry, black currant, chocolate, plum, toasty oak and spice flavors. It's so good now thay you can drink it, but it holds the inherent balance to age for up to 15 years."
Novelty Hill 2005 Columbia Valley Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Novelty Hill,Merlot,Columbia Valley,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"If Washington “owns” Merlot as a category in the U.S. (not that anyone cares at the moment), this confirms it. You get ripe, sweet, tangy red berry fruit, fresh acids, ripe tannins and toasty oak; there may not be a better value in the country. The way the oak is used is magnificent and adds layer after layer to the extended finish."
Maryhill 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,83,$17.0,Paul Gregutt,"Thin to the verge of being empty of fruit and flavor, this shows no varietal character whatsoever. Green, leafy, herbal and earthy flavors abound."
River Road 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),River Road,Pinot Noir,Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$19.0,Virginie Boone,"This is a thick, concentrated wine, full bodied in its toasty oak and bursts of cherry-vanilla. Oaky and soft, it possesses a funk of earthiness."
Heron Hill 2012 Reserve Morris Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Finger Lakes),Heron Hill,Pinot Blanc,Reserve Morris Vineyard,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Hints of spring ramps and earth blow off with aeration to reveal pretty floral and lemon aromas on this off-dry, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc. The palate is a bit demure in fruit concentration, but brisk lemon-lime acidity shines through the richly textured palate."
Trisaetum 2014 Estates Reserve Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley),Trisaetum,Riesling,Estates Reserve Dry,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,94,$38.0,Paul Gregutt,"Trisaetum produces both a dry and an off-dry cuvée from each of its three estate vineyards, as well as two versions of an Estates Reserve. Richer and bigger overall than the individual cuvées, this dry bottling is smooth and round, with a palate-pleasing blend of citrus flesh and peel, notably orange. There's tangerine and spice as well, and the wine continues bright and long through a most engaging finish."
Cairdeas 2011 Consonance Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cairdeas,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Consonance,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$34.0,Paul Gregutt,"This Bordeaux-style blend is bone dry and scented strongly with dried leaves, earth and herbs. The lightly-ripened fruit suggests pomegranate and rhubarb."
Paraduxx 2011 C Blend Red (Napa Valley),Paraduxx,Red Blend,C Blend,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$52.0,Virginie Boone,"This holds 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Zinfandel and 1% Petit Verdot. It satisfies in dusty dried cranberry and chocolate components, offering all-around balance with a shot of brawn, the latter most likely from the Cab's birthplace on Howell Mountain."
Matrix 2013 Estate Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley),Matrix,Petite Sirah,Estate,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$34.0,Virginie Boone,"There's a lot to like in this thickly ripe wine, so dark purple in color as to be almost paint. Lipsmacking black and blue berries ride a wave of smoky tannin, chocolate and power, the acidity moderate."
Kendall-Jackson 2003 Stature Red (Napa Valley),Kendall-Jackson,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Stature,California,Napa Valley,US,95,$95.0,,"Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only."
Treleaven 2007 Late Harvest Vignoles (Finger Lakes),Treleaven,Vignoles,Late Harvest,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$23.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"Impressive and elegant, with flowers and zippy citrus, pineapple and melon on the nose and refreshing waves of lemon, lime and a touch of tropical fruit to round it out on the palate. Creamy on the tongue but balanced, with a touch of orange peel on the finish."
Stags' Leap Winery 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Stags' Leap Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,94,$35.0,,"Structured and built for the long haul, the densely packed aromatics hint at the power within. Blackberry, earth, fruitcake and cinnamon are all there, and the palate delivers a similar mix with added coffee, cocoa and licorice elements. Great texture and weight, and a lengthy finish with dry, even tannins. Best if cellared four to six years, and will keep for ages."
Fox Run 2010 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Fox Run,Chardonnay,Blanc de Blancs,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$30.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Savory notes of pressed apple and golden toast accent this bristling, bright sparkling Chardonnay. On the palate, thick, dense mouth-filling foam carries flavors of zesty lemon and pear speckled with savory herbs."
Napa Angel by Montes 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Napa Angel by Montes,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$56.0,,"Rich and ripe, this has liberally oaked flavors of blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and anise. It shows Napa Valley pedigree, but it's tannic now, with mouth-numbing astringency. Try holding this until 2016, then give it a decanting."
Anthony Nappa 2013 Enzo Riesling (Finger Lakes),Anthony Nappa,Riesling,Enzo,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$50.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Named after the winemaker's newborn son, Enzo is a bold unabashedly unique take on Finger Lakes Riesling in the hands of a Long Island producer. Made from grapes frozen on the vine and fermented via indigenous yeast in French oak, it's intensely spicy, wafting of caramel and candied orange rinds. The palate is unctuously honeyed but dusted by layers of earth and mineral. It's a far departure from a classic ice wine yet intriguingly complex and impeccably balanced."
Woodinville Wine Cellars 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Woodinville Wine Cellars,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"Tart, juic, and peppery, with blackberry and boysenberry fruit. Though rather herbal and tannic, it displays good balance and moderate concentration."
Twenty Bench 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Twenty Bench,Chardonnay,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$18.0,Virginie Boone,"There's a world of lemon chiffon and vanilla crème brûlée in this wine, both aromatically and in taste. Medium weight and well-balanced, it delivers a hit of tart lemon on the finish."
Lucie 2014 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Lucie,Chardonnay,Dutton Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"An unusually heady, floral exploration of the variety, this is intense in oak and youthfully coy. Crisp, it has an intriguing undercurrent of graham cracker and toast that invites amongst the baked apple and tree-ripened pear, finishing with length and complexity."
Retro 2009 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),Retro,Petite Sirah,,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$32.0,,"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink now–2020."
Inspire Moore 2012 Lust Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),Inspire Moore,Pinot Noir,Lust,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$26.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ripe, ruddy cassis and blackberry are threaded with woody tones of briar and tobacco in this lush Pinot Noir. It's rich and silky on the palate, but marked by pert acidity and a long, velveteen finish."
Rutherford Hill 2012 Barrel Select Red (Napa Valley),Rutherford Hill,Red Blend,Barrel Select,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"Sanguine, this Merlot-dominant blend is juicy with well-toned structure and length. Smaller percentages of Syrah and Malbec provide succulence and softness, while also offering a density of black cherry and berry, finished in dark chocolate."
Marimar Estate 2012 La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Marimar Estate,Chardonnay,La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"Estate-grown from a 30-acre plot planted to three different Chardonnay clones, this wine is robust and hearty in wood, white peach and papaya. With ample acidity, it remains balanced and mouthfilling, with an edginess finished off by a tart lemon flavor."
Cinco 2011 Chardonnnay,Cinco,Chardonnnay,,New York,N A,US,177,$400.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Three Rivers 2010 Bacchus Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Three Rivers,Riesling,Bacchus Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"Off-dry, with flavors of fresh pear drizzled with honey. It's a charming Riesling, fruity and gently sweet, though with enough backing acid to keep it food-friendly."
Bing Livehaanger 2008 Riesling Rioja,Bing Livehaanger,Riesling Rioja,,New York,,US,96,$303.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
B.R. Cohn 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),B.R. Cohn,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$40.0,,"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results. The wine is dry, silky and interesting, showing an array of cherry, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors. Has enough of a complex tannin structure to pair with lamb chops, or a great grilled salmon steak."
Shalestone 2013 Beyond Rosé (Finger Lakes),Shalestone,Rosé,Beyond,New York,Finger Lakes,US,83,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ruby in color yet delicate in extract, this blend of Zweigelt and Lemberger is a concession between a red and rosé wine. On the palate, bright red-berry flavors are layered in unusual tones of caramel and spice. The label suggests it can be served both chilled and at room temperature."
Signorello 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Signorello,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$50.0,,"Shows all the hallmarks of a wine that will improve with mid-term aging. The flavors leap out now, and are all about ripe, crushed blackberries, red and black currants, anise and sweet, smoky cedar. Yet there's a tannic interference that's a little hard and astringent. Decant, if you have to open, but should hit its stride after 2009."
Burt Herngeif 2013 Musk Melon Chardonnay,Burt Herngeif,Musk Melon Chardonnay,,Mars,NA,US,162,$268.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Skyfall 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Skyfall,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$14.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This variety's signature dried- and fresh-herb aromas are on full display, with light barrel spices in the background. The palate brings lightly sweet plum and currant flavors that provide appeal."
Keuka Spring 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Keuka Spring,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$25.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"Blueberry, blackberry and cherry on the nose are followed by integrated but sophisticated flavors of cherry, dark fruit and spice. A friendly, elegant wine with some aging potential; pair with venison, beef."
Hopper Creek 2005 Massa Ranch Petit Verdot (Napa Valley),Hopper Creek,Petit Verdot,Massa Ranch,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$40.0,,"The oak and sweet jam flavors still haven't quite come together in this wine despite its age, and probably never will. With crisp acids and soft tannins, it's a nice, rich red wine to drink now."
J Vineyards & Winery 2005 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling Blend,Vintage Brut,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$48.0,,"You can taste the dosage on this Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier brut in the overt sweetness that accompanies the pear, citrus and raspberry fruit flavors. With noticeable residual sugar, it's not really a dry sparkling wine, but it is delicious."
Darioush 2014 Sage Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Darioush,Sauvignon Blanc,Sage Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"From the producer's estate vineyard on Mount Veeder, this 100% varietal vineyard designate is oaky, viscous and intensely flavored with green apple, melon and peach. Delicious honeysuckle and grapefruit peel aromas make it all the more compelling, balancing its voluptuous weight and ripeness."
Talisman 2014 Sadie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Talisman,Pinot Noir,Sadie's Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"This is the producer's first release from this site. It succeeds wildly with its juicy, tart flavors of cranberry and red cherry that become fleshy and concentrated on the palate. Complex and delicious, it finishes with a thickness of toast and black tea."
Siduri 2015 Muirfield Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Siduri,Pinot Noir,Muirfield Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"The vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, though the label simply reads Willamette Valley. Light toast and dark fruits abound, with black cherry, char and roasted-coffee flavors leading the charge. Utterly delicious, this is a fine single-vineyard offering from Adam Lee. The barrel aging is subtle and complex, with a hint of coconut in the finish."
Winc 2011 Porter and Plot Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Winc,Cabernet Sauvignon,Porter and Plot,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$31.0,Virginie Boone,"This 100% varietal wine is aged in American oak, offering an approachable, rounded, full-bodied impression of pencil shavings, cherry, leather and tobacco bound by firm tannins."
Keuka Spring 2014 Dry Wiltberger Vineyard Field Blend Rosé (Finger Lakes),Keuka Spring,Rosé,Dry Wiltberger Vineyard Field Blend,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Just a touch pink, this delicately hued rosé penetrates with fresh watermelon and raspberry flavors. Vivid and crisp, it's elegantly mineral and boasts a cool—almost alpine—freshness making it perfect for summer months."
Hanna 1999 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Hanna,Sauvignon Blanc,Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$24.0,,"Starts off with a real blast of grass, hay, anise and other aggressive notes, with just a hint of softer melon. It's pretty powerful in the mouth, too. Citrus flavors are spicy and penetrating in this dry, structured wine. It has an extra dimension of complexity and elegance that make it a fine dinner wine. —S.H."
Dominican Oaks 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Dominican Oaks,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,82,$20.0,,"Soft and dull, with simple blackberry Lifesaver candy flavors that let the heat from alcohol show through."
Roco 2015 Marsh Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir,Roco,Pinot Noir,Marsh Estate Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"This tightly wound wine offers firm purple fruit flavors, along with a touch of sweet berries. There's ample acidity and a slightly chalky finish."
Bellwether 2012 A&D Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Bellwether,Riesling,A&D Vineyard Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$22.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of smoke lend a savory feel to pressed apple notes on this dry, delicately framed wine. The palate bristles with lemon-lime acidity and finishes long and lean with a hint of wet stones."
Foundry 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Foundry,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,84,$54.0,Virginie Boone,"This wine is dull and diluted in nebulous black fruit and a medium-sized body, with plenty of supportive tannins. The finish is quick."
Cheeky Vole 2007 Schnitzel,Cheeky Vole,Schnitzel,,Mars,NA,US,204,$57.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Atwater 2013 North Block Nine Syrah (Finger Lakes),Atwater,Syrah,North Block Nine,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$30.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Luscious, sun-kissed black plum and cherry flavors are offset by a revitalizing crush of pomegranate acidity in this briskly composed Syrah. It's satisfyingly ripe, but complex tones of graphite and smoke maintain an appealing edge. Shows well now, but could improve through 2020."
Signaterra 2009 San Remo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Signaterra,Pinot Noir,San Remo Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$49.0,,"There sure is a lot of ripe flavor in this Pinot, which swamps the tastebuds with raspberries, cherries, vanilla and sweet oak. It's basically a dry wine, with smooth tannins, but it is deficient in acidity. That steals some liveliness, and makes the richness taste flat."
Three Sticks 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Three Sticks,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"This powerful Pinot is not for the meek or easily afraid. It's a heavyweight in its prime, stemmy and unabashedly full-throttled in juicy Bing cherry, blackberry and raspberry. Though generous in style, it remains coiled in acidity, with springtime aromas of just-picked rose, proving beauty can come in a substantial package."
Chehalem 2012 Three Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Chehalem,Pinot Gris,Three Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"It clocks in at an astonishing 15% alcohol, but does not show it in terms of flavor. The fruit is plenty ripe and a bit thick, but well-supported with acidity. Nonetheless the wine seems heavy and monolithic, having lost some of the vivid freshness of the other Chehalem white wines from this vintage."
Revival 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Revival,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$125.0,Virginie Boone,"This is a satisfying, small-production wine from four rows of the family's Kairos Vineyard, a study in sanguine intensity. Currant, cassis and tar integrate with the body of subtle oak and tannin, finishing in a sprinkling of dried herb and graphite."
Mossback 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Mossback,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$25.0,,"This is a good Pinot Noir. While it's not an ager because it's made for immediate consumption, it does show an elegant structure. Crisp acidity provides balance to the cola, cherry, pomegranate, spice and smoky vanilla flavors."
Rutherford Hill 2013 Malbec (Napa Valley),Rutherford Hill,Malbec,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"Juicy black plum finds a robust tension of tar, licorice and meat in a full-bodied expression of this grape, more usually found in blends in the Napa Valley than standing on its own. This one achieves a balance between power and smoky succulence."
Columbia Crest 2005 Beverly Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Cabernet Franc,Beverly Vineyard Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"A scintillating scent of rose petals opens up this pleasing wine, which continues with raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with light milk chocolate. It is not a heavy wine; in fact, if Franc can ever be called elegant, even feminine, this is how it should taste. The finish falls off rather quickly, but otherwise it is a fine effort."
Bellangelo 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Bellangelo,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ebullient on the nose with scents of fresh white peach and tart Meyer-lemon. This dry Riesling is deliciously peachy on the palate, as well. Juicy and brisk with soft citrus acidity, it finishes with a hint of waxy lime-skin on the finish."
Standing Stone 2005 Pinnacle Red (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pinnacle,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$23.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"Blueberry, black cherry and red berries on the nose are followed by structured but slightly tart red fruit flavors on the palate.  Diverse spices and some oak add weight and balance the edge. The wine is generally food friendly and flavorful."
Rippey 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),Rippey,Merlot,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$30.0,Virginie Boone,"Shy on the nose, this wine has dry, sticky tannins that cling to a wall of high-toned red fruit, mostly plum, forming a medium weight on the palate. Softening out as it goes, it leaves black pepper on the finish."
Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2013 Homestead Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,Riesling,Homestead Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$24.0,Anna Lee C.

While off dry in style, it's intensely mineral with a lemon-lime zing that reverberates on the finish."
Tangley Oaks 2006 Lot #10 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Tangley Oaks,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lot #10,California,Napa Valley,US,83,$32.0,,"Tough and gritty, with edgy tannins framing rustic flavors of blackberries and sweetened berry tea."

Virage 2010 Red (Napa Valley),Virage,Red Blend,,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$54.0,Virginie Boone,"From a challenging Napa Valley vintage, this red is made in what the winemaker calls a “Right Bank” style, blending 56% Cabernet Franc with 42% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon from vineyards such as Hyde in Carneros. The wine is brimming in dark plum and severe chocolate and cherry, with a reasonable amount of grip."
Willamette Valley Vineyards 2010 Tualatin Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Tualatin Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"Crisply defined, this cuvée, from a vineyard well to the north in the Willamette Valley, has highlights of pine and herb. The fruit is a mix of pomegranate and orange peel, sharp and penetrating."
Darioush 2001 Signature Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Darioush,Chardonnay,Signature,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$38.0,,"Crisp acidity blends easily with creamy smooth texture here. This is a fine juxtaposition of mineral, apple, pear, spice and citrus flavors, neatly layered for complexity and eleganty structured. Long and bright at the end."
Grgich Hills 1999 Merlot (Napa Valley),Grgich Hills,Merlot,,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$38.0,,"Dense, dark and lush, an extracted wine made from very ripe grapes that brim with dark berry and black stone fruit flavors.

Iijima,"Big, bold fruit and penetrating tannins mark this lush, powerful Cabernet Franc.

Maison L'Envoyé 2015 The Attaché Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Maison L'Envoyé,Pinot Noir,The Attaché,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"This cuvée is a barrel selection, fermented with whole berries and aged in 35% new oak. Simple strawberry and raspberry fruit seems almost weightless, and the quick finish carries a strong streak of bouillon."
Rooster Hill 2010 Medium Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),Rooster Hill,Riesling,Medium Sweet,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Luscious tropical fruit and jasmine notes are framed by hints of fresh green herb and grass. A spray of lemony acidity and smoky white-tea notes add delicate flair to the finish.

Rich but not heavy, it will pair well with cured meats, cheeses, heartier dishes."
Sweet Cheeks 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Sweet Cheeks,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Fresh, forward and fruity, this brings light strawberry fruit and streaks of root beer. It's tasty and quaffable, though done in a lighter style."
Balletto 2011 Winery Block Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Balletto,Pinot Noir,Winery Block Estate,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$38.0,,"With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style."
Grgich Hills 2011 Essence Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Grgich Hills,Sauvignon Blanc,Essence Estate Grown,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$48.0,,"After years of tinkering with Sauvignon Blanc, Grgich Hills has finally produced a truly notable bottling—its best ever.

Lakewood 2013 Gigliotti Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Lakewood,Pinot Gris,Gigliotti Vineyards,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of orange blossom and lemon rind lend vibrancy to this rich, luxuriously textured Pinot Gris.

Merry Edwards 2001 Klopp Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,Pinot Noir,Klopp Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$48.0,,"From the southern, cooler part of the valley, but on a sunny ridge above the fog, a fascinating study in contrasts. It has brilliantly crisp, citrusy acidity, but is a fat, fleshy wine, with mouthwatering flavors of black cherries, cola, mocha and gingersnap. The scour of dusty tannins on the finish suggests this wine will hold for several years."

Conn Creek 2008 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),Conn Creek,Cabernet Franc,,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$25.0,,"A little bitter and rough around the edges, but a very delicious wine, with lots of cherry, red currant, liqueur, bacon, Dr. Pepper cola and cinnamon spice flavors.

Beaulieu Vineyard 2004 Dulcet Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Napa Valley),Beaulieu Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Dulcet Reserve,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$40.0,,"As the name implies, it's a soft, gentle wine. Quality has varied over the years. The '04 is one of the better vintages, a complex but accessible wine with polished black currant, dark- chocolate truffle and anise liqueur flavors. Drink now and through 2010."
Armanino Family Cellars 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Armanino Family Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reserve,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$95.0,,"A rich, sleek Cabernet, made in a controlled manner emphasizing dry elegance rather than massive fruit.

Gary Farrell 2013 Russian River Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Gary Farrell,Chardonnay,Russian River Selection,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"There's a reductive element to the nose of this wine, indicating the powerful nature of the vintage but also the wine's youth. Let it open to unveil an intensity of baked apple and white peach, along with heartier highlights of crème brûlée and vanilla toast. With a medium body and length, it has enough acidity to remain vibrant. It's sourced from a who's who of the region's vineyards."
Coeur de Terre 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Coeur de Terre,Pinot Noir,Oregon,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"A lightly funky whiff of the chicken yard underlies the aromatics, but for most tasters it will be an asset, as it does not block the pretty cherry fruit. These forward, appealing cherry flavors, matched to natural acidity and lengthened with that whiff of funk, make for a delicious and value-priced effort."

WesMar 2007 Salzgeber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),WesMar,Pinot Noir,Salzgeber Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$50.0,,"Dry and silky, a very proper Pinot Noir from this fine, cool vintage. It's marked in youth by brisk acids and forward, somewhat one-dimensional flavors of cherries, cola and spices, with the smoky sandalwood of barrel age. Could develop all kinds of surprises over the next 4–6 years."
Arbor Brook 2008 Heritage Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Arbor Brook,Pinot Noir,Heritage Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"A sexy nose with soft, pretty plum and cherry fruit leads into a well-rounded, satiny wine that coats the tongue like a velvet glove.

Cave B 2008 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cave B,Cabernet Franc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,83,$28.0,Paul Gregutt,"Cabernet Franc often shows more stem and herb than either Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon, but here there is little else to hang your hat on. Hard, chewy and tannic, it might best be drunk with a grilled steak, so those tough tannins are put to work."
Damiani 2014 Davis Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Riesling,Davis Vineyard Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$22.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Freshly-pressed apples and pears are accented by hints of bramble and earth in this slightly savory dry Riesling. Zesty lemon-lime acidity adds brightness to a long, lingering finish. Drink now through 2019."
Quilceda Creek 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Quilceda Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,98,$135.0,Paul Gregutt,"A bold, muscular, striking wine with nerves of steel, this offers a dense, demanding array of black fruit threaded with veins of espresso, smoke, tar, tobacco and iron. As it bursts with exotic barrel flavor, the fruit seems a bit buried, but time after time these wines unfold over the course of decades into glorious maturity. These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country."
Noble Estate 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Noble Estate,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$29.0,Paul Gregutt,"Substantial and authoritative, this ripe and tannic wine turns quickly to the dark side. Dark fruits—black cherry and cassis—are joined to barrel flavors of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Yet it's never too heavy, and stays balanced through a medium-long finish."
Columbia Crest 2010 Walter Clore Private Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Walter Clore Private Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"The blend has changed a bit with this latest Walter Clore Private Reserve, now 53% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Cabernet Franc—no Malbec. It seems a bit chewy and chalky. The fruit has a slightly candied aspect, with suggestions of fruitcake."
Robert Weil 2007 Riesling,Robert Weil,Riesling,,California,NA,US,203,$47.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Dr. Konstantin Frank 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,91,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"With a palate-drenching fountain of peach nectar, grapefruit and orange blossom notes, this Finger Lakes standard packs a surprising punch in the 2014 vintage. Dry, yet intensely ripe, it boasts long, lingering streaks of honey and fruit offset by zigzagging daggers of lime zest and lemon. It's penetrating and deliciously persistent."

Iijima,"Hints of coffee grinds and fresh, green herbs add interesting dimension to concentrated, ripe blackberry notes.

Monte Smith 2014 Leras Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Monte Smith,Pinot Noir,Leras Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$28.0,Virginie Boone,"This is made from a cool vineyard site, low in elevation and often covered in fog. The wine is sultry and velvety, with a smoky edge wrapped in candied cherry and cinnamon. It's overdelivers in terms of price as well."
Billsboro 2013 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Billsboro,Riesling,Sawmill Creek Vineyards Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Orange blossoms, grapefruit piths and freshly cut pineapple explode on the nose of this perfumed, yet impeccably elegant Riesling. It's gossamer-light in texture, but deeply concentrated with generous streaks of ripe yellow peach and tangerine. A bristle of bitter lime zest accompanies a long finish. Gorgeous now but substantial enough to mature well though at least 2023."
Fog Crest 2014 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Fog Crest,Pinot Noir,Estate Bottled,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$55.0,Virginie Boone,"Juicy and slightly reduced, this tightly woven wine shows layers of cranberry, citrus and tea, all wrapped within a cocoon of forested earth and medium-weight body."
Amity 2006 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Amity,Riesling,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$17.0,Paul Gregutt,"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish."
Woodenhead 2012 Dolinsek Ranch Syrah (Russian River Valley),Woodenhead,Syrah,Dolinsek Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$40.0,Virginie Boone,"Licorice and leather stand out in this softly layered wine that leans heavy on the palate. Made in a full-bodied, brawny style, it's single-minded more than complex, finishing in toasty oak and black pepper."
Chateau Lafite Rothschild 2009 Vinegar,Chateau Lafite Rothschild,Vinegar,,Oregano,,US,41,$248.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Houdini 2008 Glendale Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Houdini,Cabernet Sauvignon,Glendale Ranch,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$40.0,,"Still dry and tannic, this has a hard, brittle mouthfeel and lots of tart acidity. It has a gigantic core of blackberry fruit."
V. Sattui 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),V. Sattui,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$22.0,,"This straddles the border between tasting dry and slightly sweet. It has good acidity, with flavors of citrus, mint green tea and vanilla."
Ponzi 2014 Avellana Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Chardonnay,Avellana Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$63.0,Paul Gregutt,"Though labeled Willamette Valley, this is single vineyard Chehalem Mountains AVA fruit. Smooth, ripe and buttery, from sniff to swallow, it's loaded with Satsuma orange, Meyer lemon and pink-grapefruit flavors. The acids snap and the finish lingers, with a streak of vanilla and a slight sensation of heat."

Sullivan,"The new French oak (60%) and rich fruit aromas and flavors play perfectly off each other. Notes of dark roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate meld with fresh herbs and dark cherries.

Williams Selyem 2007 Papera Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Zinfandel,Papera Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$48.0,,"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years."
Migration 2012 Searby Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Migration,Chardonnay,Searby Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$55.0,Virginie Boone,"A site planted to the Rued clone of Chardonnay in classic Russian River Valley Goldridge soils, Searby is expressive in honeysuckle and orange blossom floral tones.

Balletto 2007 Burnside Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Balletto,Pinot Noir,Burnside Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$34.0,,"If you open this bottle before late 2009, you'll find a tightly wound wine marked by acidity and tannins. In other words, not showing its best. Inside the structure is remarkably ripe fruit, along the lines of cherries, currants, pomegranates and cola. It's a big, exuberant wine, but it does need time, and has the balance to achieve it."
Ponzi 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Chardonnay,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"If you like a bigger, broader style, with plenty of toast and buttery goodness, this is the one for you.

Iijima,"Tart, penetrating notes of lime, green apple and greengage plum accentuate the cool, crisp quality of this dry Riesling. It's zingy and lean in constitution, but concentrated and complex in flavors, shaded with deep tones of earth and mineral that seem omnipresent in Bloomer Creek's 2013 vintage."

It's also very strongly flavored. The fruit detonates in the mouth, offering a flood of blackberries, black cherries, black raspberries and currants, with complex notes of unsweetened baker's chocolate and peppery Provençal herbs and lavender. May calm down with a few years in the bottle."

Trailhead 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Trailhead,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$18.0,,"A very nice Sauvignon Blanc, and a good followup to the equally fine 2009, at a fair price. It straddles the line between dry and a little sweet, with brisk acidity boosting citrus, sweet hay, vanilla and white pepper flavors."
Castle Rock 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Castle Rock,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,84,$18.0,,Too oaky and forward in tropical fruit flavors. Takes the popular style and exaggerates it. It will nonetheless appeal to lots of people.
Dr. Konstantin Frank 2014 Muskat Ottonel (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Muskat Ottonel,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A whiff of bergamot lends musky floral intensity to this peachy featherweight wine. It's perfumed but not at all cloying, etched finely with a lingering lace of crystalline sugar. Drink now through 2017."
Fox Run 2013 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Fox Run,Cabernet Franc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Rich, ripe black-cherry and plum flavors penetrate throughout this plump, juicy Cabernet Franc.

Iijima,"Forward and rich, with flavors of luscious red cherries spiked with cola and purple flowers, this is an easy-drinking yet undeniably tasty blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big, chunky tannins and a spray of sour-cherry acidity add depth and verve to the midpalate."
Acorn 2008 Axiom Alegría Vineyards Syrah (Russian River Valley),Acorn,Syrah,Axiom Alegría Vineyards,California,Russian River Valley,US,86,$33.0,,"Too sharp in texture, with a cut of acidity that emphasizes the white pepper, and seems to bring out some greenness. Other than that, you'll find a smoothly tannic wine, with blackberry and currant fruit."
Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),Crane Brothers,Syrah,Crane Ranch Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$36.0,,"This Syrah has a lovely mouthfeel, with soft, plush tannins, clean acids and a dry, balanced finish. The flavors are of black currants, roasted meat, violets, anise and crushed black pepper. Has some green notes, but it's a nice glass of wine."
Cheeky Vole 2012 Sake,Cheeky Vole,Sake,,Fhloston Paradise,,US,128,$388.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Script 2012 Stage Right Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Script,Cabernet Franc,Stage Right,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$45.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Hailing principally from Two Blondes Vineyard, the aromas of cocoa, savory herbs, pencil shavings, anise and spice are followed by fruit flavors so soft and plush you just want to sink into them. The finish lingers. It explores the variety's more savory side."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Cold Creek Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,Riesling,Cold Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$16.0,Sean P.

Midsummer Cellars 2009 Clark-Claudon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Midsummer Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clark-Claudon Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$44.0,,"This is a vigorous young Cabernet, fresh and jammy in blackberry, cassis and new oak notes. The tannins are thick, smooth and flashy, and should protect the wine as it glides on its aging journey. Best after 2015."
Damiani 2010 Sunrise Hill Vineyard Lemberger (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Lemberger,Sunrise Hill Vineyard,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While the nose of this Lemberger is quite voluptuous, with aromas of ripe black cherries and plum, the palate highlights crisp, slightly tart blackberry flavor. It's full bodied in style, yet refreshing with acidity and finishes quite brisk."
Feather 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Feather,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,94,$55.0,Paul Gregutt,"Randy Dunn's Feather has an intriguing floral component, and the aromas are complex and intense, though the wine is wound up tight.

Red Newt Cellars 2011 Curry Creek Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Pinot Gris,Curry Creek Vineyards,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$24.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A hint of smoke mingles with fresh apple and pear aromas on this delicate, but silky and textured Pinot Gris.

Burgess 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley),Burgess,Syrah,,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$30.0,,"Good for Burgess for holding this Syrah back for a little while. It's beginning to soften, just barely. The tannins are still strong, but you can taste those bright blackberries and cherries starting to show meaty hints of wild grilled portobello mushrooms. It will drink well in late 2014 with hearty roasts and stews."
MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2014 Winemaker's Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),MacMurray Estate Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Winemaker's Block,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"Velvety, robust structure makes way for a textured, complex personality of baked plum, rhubarb and cola spice. That spice continues in lengthy spikes of clove and cinnamon, providing a warmth that complements and accents the concentration."
O•S Winery 2011 16th Street Bridge Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),O•S Winery,Red Blend,16th Street Bridge,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"Principally Cabernet Franc, it's tight and reductive, with a tarry note.

Redhawk 2012 Grateful Red Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Redhawk,Pinot Noir,Grateful Red,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"Light and charming, this slips into gear gently and then surprises with some tannic grip. Flavors combine root beer and strawberry highlights. For Willamette Valley Pinot Noir, it offers exceptional value."
Spindrift Cellars 2006 Woodhall Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Spindrift Cellars,Chardonnay,Woodhall Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"This elegant blend of stainless- and barrel-aged lots captures the fresh fruit flavors of red apples, kiwi and lime, letting just a hint of barrel toast creep into the finish. It's leesy and bracing, finished at 14.8% alcohol but tasting much lighter."
àMaurice 2009 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),àMaurice,Malbec,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"Pretty and deep, this has notes of juicy boysenberry, blueberry and cherry. The balanced acidity and racy tannins give it substance and style."
Stolen Identity 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Stolen Identity,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$17.0,Paul Gregutt,You'll have to look in the very lower left hand corner of the back label to spot the vintage on this bottle (2014). The soft cherry fruit has a buttery mouthfeel. The wine is lightly toasty and eminently accessible. Drink now through 2020.
Snoqualmie 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Snoqualmie,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$10.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is a steely, herbal, high-acid Merlot, with pale red fruit flavors of cranberry and currant.

Matthews Estate 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Matthews Estate,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$39.0,Paul Gregutt,"Solid Syrah character is evident—pomegranate, wild berry, and gamy streaks of soy and earth and peppery spice woven into the flavors. Light chocolate adds interest to the finish, but some chalkiness (from unintegrated acids?) detracts from the finish."
Kenwood 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Kenwood,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$16.0,,"A small Pinot Noir, rustic and simple, but not without its charms. Has a silky mouthfeel housing pleasant raspberry and cherry Lifesaver candy flavors."
Roco 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Roco,Chardonnay,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is stunningly rich in mouthfeel, texture and overall weight.

Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2012 Semidry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Chateau Lafayette Reneau,Riesling,Semidry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Delicate mineral inflections lend elegance to flavors of pink grapefruit and peach on this sprightly semi-dry Riesling. Sunny with soft, Meyer-lemon acidity, it's a bit dainty on the palate but has enough power to drive a moderately long finish."
Testarossa 2008 Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Testarossa,Pinot Noir,Graham Family Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$54.0,,"Vigorous and tannic, this young Pinot is hard right now. It also seems a little unbalanced, with some raisins and mint bracketing the cherries. Could just be going through an awkward youth. Try in 2011."
Eagle Eye 2011 Estate AlphaWOLF Ranch Petit Verdot (Napa Valley),Eagle Eye,Petit Verdot,Estate AlphaWOLF Ranch,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"Masterfully puckering tannins greet the palate, challenging the taster to discern the hidden waves of blueberry, vanilla and black licorice behind the wall. Full-bodied, it needs plenty of time and air before enjoying."
Michael Florentino 2009 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Michael Florentino,Sangiovese,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$26.0,Paul Gregutt,"Purely varietal, this is a soft and peppery wine, with tastes of berry and chocolate. Despite the relatively high alcohol, it feels light and simple, without depth or complexity."
Williams Selyem 2013 Papera Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Zinfandel,Papera Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$55.0,Virginie Boone,"Continuing to preserve this historic vineyard, a rare planting of the variety within the appellation, this is an elegant yet explosive bottling.

Black Stallion 2012 Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Black Stallion,Cabernet Sauvignon,Limited Release,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$75.0,Virginie Boone,"There's a density and concentration to this wine that many will find appealing, a mix of leathery cigar box and unfussy notions of clove and currant. Silky-smooth on the palate, it's full bodied and robust, made entirely from Cabernet."
Riboli 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Riboli,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate Grown,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"Dense and dusty, this is a hugely built, ripely round wine, muscular and robust in leather, tobacco and black currant. It offers an additional tease of chocolate and cigar as it opens in the glass."
Browne Family Vineyards 2012 Tribute Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Browne Family Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tribute,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$30.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 12% Cabernet Franc and 9% Petit Verdot seems slightly muddled, with notes of dried herbs, flowers, barrel spices and plum. Flavors are soft and chocolaty, with an elegant styling and grainy tannins."
Arista 2009 Mononi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Arista,Pinot Noir,Mononi Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$60.0,,"So fresh and jammy in raspberry and cherry fruit, so tannic and acidic, so overtly oaky, it seems like a wine to stick in the cellar for 3–5 years to let it mellow out. It's good and rich and impressive, but too much of everything at this point."
Faust 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Faust,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"Sanguine, gamy and powerful from the first moment onward, this 80% Cabernet Sauvignon also has 16% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. The power on the front palate evolves over time into black cherry and cassis, with shades of mocha lurking in. Firm and oaky, give this time, through 2018–2020."
Juslyn Vineyards 2003 Perry's Blend Red (Napa Valley),Juslyn Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Perry's Blend,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$65.0,,"A very good wine, rich and packed with flavor.

Waterbrook 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Waterbrook,Chardonnay,Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"Strong scents and flavors of oak and spice mask the fruit. It feels a bit flat on the palate, as if heading toward early oxidation. The oak and butterscotch flavors carry through onto the finish. Two bottles tasted."
C&T; 2006 Backyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),C&T;,Chardonnay,Backyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$17.0,,"Here's a rich, opulent wine. It's definitely high in acidity, which gives it a citrusy bite, but that zippiness provides a firm counterpoint to the lush tropical fruit, buttered toast and spice flavors."
Beaulieu Vineyard 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Beaulieu Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$23.0,,"Beaulieu does what it's done so well for so long, producing a Cabernet that reflects real Napa character, at a good price. The wine is dry and fancy, with an elegant structure of acids and tannins housing classic black currant, herb and cedar flavors. With production of 43,000 cases, it's easy to find."
Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Riesling,Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Lip-smacking white peach and grapefruit flavors abound in this semidry Riesling, but are anchored by a deep vein of minerals. It's piercing and fresh, yet quaffable and delicious, struck by shards of lime and lemon and a lingering touch of honey."
Willamette Valley Vineyards 2015 Vintage 42 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley Vineyards,Chardonnay,Vintage 42,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"Willamette Valley Vineyards' vintner Bill Fuller planted the Draper clone vines that go into this wine at his Tualatin Vineyards in 1973. Buttery barrel flavors are immediately apparent—highlights of butterscotch, vanilla and spice around a core of ripe apple fruit. It seems to gather strength throughout the sip, with a lingering finish. Drink 2019–2030."
Abiqua Wind 2011 Caleb Knorr Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Abiqua Wind,Pinot Gris,Caleb Knorr,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$12.0,Paul Gregutt,"Fruity and tasting of lemon, melon and pineapple, this clean and fresh Pinot Gris offers fair value for the price. It tastes slightly off dry."
Red Tail Ridge 2008 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes),Red Tail Ridge,Rosé,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$17.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"A subtle, pretty nose of vanilla, cherry and strawberry is backed up by bigger flavors of sour cherry, spice and vanilla. Fun and exuberant but not terribly delicate. A good match with meats and poultry."
Firebrix 2013 Vineyard Selection The Fresh Market Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Firebrix,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vineyard Selection The Fresh Market,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is straight down the Cabernet fairway with aromas and flavors of black and green olive, plum, herbs, mocha and pencil lead. It's soft in feel with a pinch of sugar stitching it all together."
Ponzi 2015 Tavola Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Pinot Noir,Tavola,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$27.0,Paul Gregutt,"Stunningly good for an entry-level Pinot Noir, this new Tavola gets the sort of care generally reserved for reserves. Native yeast fermentation and almost a year in 20% new French oak is where it starts; then a barrel selection is made and it's bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deep flavors emphasize black fruits, with a dash of pepper highlighting the finish."
Alpha Omega 2014 Riesling,Alpha Omega,Riesling,,Washingtonne,NA,US,21,$354.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Dr. Konstantin Frank 2015 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Rosé,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Intensely fruity notes of red currant and raspberry abound on this fragrant full-bodied rosé. It's boldly concentrated on the palate as well, bursting of fresh berry and plum flavors. Primary and juicy in style, yet elegant and penetrating, it's an excellent rosé for year-round consumption—if you can still find a bottle."
Standing Stone 2011 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$11.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Hints of nuts add a savory tone to subtle apple flavors on this dry Chardonnay.

This is an elegant, sculpted wine, built upon a sturdy foundation of supple, ripe Columbia Valley fruit. Raspberry and cherry flavors get a spicy lift from the Petit Verdot, while the Cabernet adds focus and heft to the tannins."
Lamoreaux Landing 2012 Estate Bottled Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,Riesling,Estate Bottled Semi-Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of smoke and herbs add complexity to this beautifully floral, fruity wine. Off-dry in style, it's richly concentrated with peach and apricot flavors that reverberate on the palate with bracing lime-toned acidity. The long finish has a bristle of lemon-zest astringency."
Bell 2011 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Bell,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"The same Bell as the well-known Napa Valley winery, Bell extends its reach into Oregon to make this lip-smackingly good Pinot Gris. Gooseberry, melon, kiwi and grapefruit flavors swirl across the tongue, leaving a clean, fresh and very fruity wake. The moderate alcohol is an added bonus."
Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2014 Homestead Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,Riesling,Homestead Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$24.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Tangerines abound throughout this intensely perfumed, concentrated wine. Dry in style, it's refreshingly citrusy, yet streaked with wet stone, petrol and struck flint. While deft and light bodied, it's persistent through a long, pleasantly astringent finish."
Standing Stone 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Cabernet Sauvignon,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Flavors of ripe plums and cherries dusted with graham cracker crumbs and purple flowers are pleasant on this delicately structured Cabernet.

Eola Hills 2015 Sparkling Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Eola Hills,Chardonnay,Sparkling,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is labeled Methode Champenoise, though its time on the lees was minimal. It's a bit of a sourball, a mix of green apple and lemon, but would be a knockout with raw oysters."
Della 2015 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Della,Pinot Noir,Keefer Ranch Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$70.0,Virginie Boone,"Earthy forest floor and sage notes make for a savory experience in this otherwise juicy wine.

Worthy 2009 Sophia's Cuvee Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),Worthy,Red Blend,Sophia's Cuvee Red Wine,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$29.0,,"This is harder than the 2008, which was released at the same time, but it shows real Napa elegance. The tannic toughness tells you to decant it for a few hours, which makes the blackberry and cassis flavors become more expressive."
Parallel 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Parallel,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$48.0,,"So rich, so opulent, this is fantastic to enjoy now. It really nails it, with intricate flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch, honey and vanilla that ride high on top of the pineapple and tropical fruit flavors. The winery is best known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but with this release, it's competing at the highest level of quality Chardonnay."
Kudos 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Kudos,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$13.0,Paul Gregutt,"A significant price drop and a riper vintage make this a fine, every day go-to Pinot Gris.

De Loach 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),De Loach,Chardonnay,Estate Grown,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"From the producer's estate vineyard planted on the Olivet Bench, this sublimely textured white is perfumed, zesty and complex. It delights in voluptuous layers of pear and honey in equal measure, showing both sides of deliciousness, fresh and fruity."
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1997 Merlot (Napa Valley),Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,Merlot,,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$35.0,,"Great vineyards, great winery, great vintage: There's lots to like about this big, bold, fruity wine that manages to be complex and elegant at the same time. Masses of blackberry, black currant and violets, with smoke and vanilla from oak aging. What's hard to convey is the balance, richness, harmony and depth of flavor, which are really stunning. Age it for a few years if you want, but it's at or near its delicious best now."
Gracianna 2013 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Gracianna,Zinfandel,Bacigalupi Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$44.0,Virginie Boone,"From the marquee vineyard just down the road, known better for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this ZInfandel has 5% Petite Sirah blended in. Combined, they offer earthy and floral elements on the nose before a juicy palate of red fruit enters. A touch of olive plays off the bittersweet finish."
Mason Cellars 2013 Yount Mill Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Mason Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,Yount Mill Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,85,$17.0,Virginie Boone,"Faintly floral in lemon and grapefruit, this is a tightly woven, smooth 100% varietal white, shy in flavor and body.

Expressive and ripe, it does justice to the warm-vintage and focused winemaking."
Porter Family Vineyards 2007 Syrah (Napa Valley),Porter Family Vineyards,Syrah,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$47.0,,"A bit tough in acidity, which seems to accentuate the ripe fruit, giving it a jammy, tart quality. The flavors are of blackberries, cherries, tangerines and sandalwood. Drink now."
Treos 2014 Albariño (Willamette Valley),Treos,Albariño,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Albariño is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more. Tart and tangy with brightly defined flavors of grapefruit, apple and pineapple, this is deliciously bracing. There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish."
Flora Springs 1999 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),Flora Springs,Sangiovese,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$16.0,,"This winery has always taken a light-handed approach to Sangiovese, preferring a delicate, drinkable wine to a ponderous one. The trend continues with this appealing release. It's deeply flavored with berry and spice, in a dry, airy package with just enough weight to qualify as a serious wine. Try it with almost anything, it's that versatile."
Chateauneuf-du-Pape 2006 Baijiu,Chateauneuf-du-Pape,Baijiu,,Mars,N A,US,201,$136.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Three Rivers 2010 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Three Rivers,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"For those who love a big, oaky Chardonnay, this is for you. It's raw, blocky and rough, but there is plenty of fresh oak flavor, and time should integrate the wood into the clean and straightforward green apple flavor."
Red Newt Cellars 2007 Curry Creek Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Pinot Gris,Curry Creek Vineyards,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$23.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"A light, elegant nose of almonds, apple and honeysuckle, followed by fresh flavors of nuts, apple and flowers on the palate.

Williams Selyem 2010 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Chardonnay,Drake Estate Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,96,$65.0,,"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts."
Betz Family 2011 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Betz Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,Père de Famille,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,95,$68.0,Paul Gregutt,"Intriguing scents focus upon chamomile and Mediterranean herbs, while the fruit flavors are wild and brambly.

Gothic 2013 Nevermore Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Gothic,Pinot Noir,Nevermore,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$24.0,Paul Gregutt,"Gothic is the project of a New York-based restaurateur and sommelier team. This spent 10 months in 15% new French oak. Scents and flavors of rubber tire dominate, and the tannins are hard and harsh. Airing it out helps a bit, but the bitterness does not entirely disappear."
Rulo 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Rulo,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Quite dry to the point of astringency, this stylish Syrah brings flavors of toast, coffee grounds and tangy berries. There is just a hint of finishing heat."
Hartford 1999 Arrendell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Hartford,Pinot Noir,Arrendell Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$65.0,,"Aromas of dark fruit, anise, smoke and dried herbs morph into flavors of stone fruits (plums, cherries) in the mouth, with a strong undercurrent of pomegranate. This thick, almost syrupy wine is almost steroidally concentrated, but stays focused thanks to lemony acids that might be too much for some tasters."
Balletto 2016 Estate Grown Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Balletto,Pinot Noir,Estate Grown Rosé of,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$18.0,Virginie Boone,"This is a richer, rounder version of rosé, with tropical mango and pineapple notes as well as lush peach aspects. Moderate acidity keeps it grounded and refreshing."
Spindrift Cellars 2016 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Spindrift Cellars,Chardonnay,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$16.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is a solid, fruity, well-priced wine that brings pear and peach flesh and skin flavors. It was briefly barrel aged and is ready for near-term drinking."
Adler Fels 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Adler Fels,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,84,$15.0,,"This simple Chardonnay is lush and ripe like a pineapple, mango and peach juice drink. Unabashedly fruity with sweetness on the finish."
Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sinclair Estate Vineyards,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"This shows a strong Bourbon barrel flavor from the new oak that is still being integrated into the fruit. Tart wild-berry flavors surfacewith air, but the impression is of a high-acid, sharply-defined Merlot; it's structured for aging."
Rex Hill 2010 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Rex Hill,Pinot Noir,Shea Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$58.0,Paul Gregutt,"This new Shea designate is focused and appealing, with streaks of cola and vanilla running through the pretty cranberry and strawberry fruit. It's balanced and nicely textured, with a dollop of moist earth accenting the tannins."
Alexana 2016 Terroir Series Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Alexana,Pinot Gris,Terroir Series,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$32.0,Paul Gregutt,"This well-made wine is concise and focused, with pinpoint flavors of cut pear holding the core. Hints of thin red berry and a whiff of tea-tree oil animate the nose. It's unusual and well made."
Roadhouse Winery 2009 Black Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Roadhouse Winery,Pinot Noir,Black,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$55.0,,"Some Pinots are light and simple. This one's light and wonderfully complex. It's so translucent, the minerals of the earth seem to be speaking through the fruit. Silky and delicate in the mouth, it conveys rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, cinnamon and smoky sandalwood. Drink over the next few years."
Patland 2013 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Patland,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stagecoach Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$110.0,Virginie Boone,"Softened and given additional color from the addition of 7% Malbec, this is a beautiful, herbaceous wine, etched in cassis and cedar. Structured, it offers subtle, nuanced oak behind its density of sage and dusty earth, a worthy expression of the vineyard atop Atlas Peak."
Loring Wine Company 2006 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Loring Wine Company,Pinot Noir,Shea Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is the first wine made from Oregon grapes by this southern California winery. But one can't help but wonder if shipping fruit all the way down the coast might bang it up a bit. For whatever reason, this wine tastes fractured, metallic and chalky. There is a core of black cherry, but it seems surrounded by gun-metal flavors, which stick to the palate and abruptly shut down the finish."
Columbia Winery 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is classic juice, hard and packed with power, showing dark fruits laced with mocha and spice. The chalky tannins are the only quibble, but this wine will improve for at least a decade in your cellar. —P.G."
Kiona 2012 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Kiona,Riesling,Late Harvest,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,92,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"As with Kiona's off-dry Washington Riesling, this includes a bit of Gewürztraminer, a clever addition that brings some spiciness into play. Intensely aromatic, the wine is almost Muscat-like, with dense orange peel flavors, along with citrus, tea and madeleine cookie. This is a sensational value from a leading Riesling producer."
àMaurice 2009 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),àMaurice,Viognier,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,92,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Always a strong suit from àMaurice, the 2009 Viognier has a cocktail mix of lemon drop and botanical herbs and spices. Pungent, bright and deliciously lively, this is a thrilling, high-wire wine."
Ventosa 2008 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),Ventosa,Pinot Noir,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Richly fruited with sweet black cherries and cassis, this deeply penetrating Pinot Noir gets a lift on the palate with cool tones of pine, menthol and pencil lead. Lively acidity and soft, feathery tannins linger on the finish."
Lamoreaux Landing 2012 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,Gewürztraminer,Estate Bottled,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Lavish blossom, peach and tropical fruit notes perfume this big-bodied wine. Off dry in style, it fills the palate with rich stone fruit and pineapple accented with peppery spice and tangerine acidity. It's a powerful yet nicely balanced wine with pleasant astringency on the finish."
Maryhill 2014 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Sangiovese,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$26.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Light in color, aromas of barrel spice, herb and red fruit rise up from the glass. The palate packs a mouthful of red-fruit flavors, with the tannins showing a bit of astringency."
Raptor Ridge 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Raptor Ridge,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$20.0,Paul Gregutt,"Loaded with scents and flavors of grapefruit, this leesy, textural Pinot Gris is bracing and mouth-filling. It's definitely on the tart side, but could be paired with a wide variety of fish and poultry dishes."
David Hill 2010 Estate BlackJack Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),David Hill,Pinot Noir,Estate BlackJack,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$55.0,Paul Gregutt,"The 2010 BlackJack is loaded with tart cranberry and pomegranate fruit flavors. There is a streak of iron and darker notes that come through in earthy, slighted roasted tannins. The complexity is intriguing and adds depth to a rather light vintage."
Herzog 2007 Special Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Herzog,Chardonnay,Special Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$36.0,,"A very nice, elegant Chardonnay that shows plenty of creamy, oaky richness of pineapples, limes and pears, but also a crisp streak of acidity and minerality that provides grounding and balance. A good example of Russian River precision."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,Riesling,Dry,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$10.0,Paul Gregutt,"Labeled dry, this nonetheless carries a hint of sweetness, at 70 g/L residual sugar.  It's fruity and fresh, with melon, citrus and peach prominent. A perfect summer sipping wine."
Silverado 2010 Miller Ranch Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Silverado,Sauvignon Blanc,Miller Ranch Estate Grown,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$22.0,,"Silverado has a mixed track record with Sauvignon Blanc, a difficult variety to get right in Napa Valley, as it's very vintage specific. It tastes a little on the sweet side, bearing flavors of green peas and oranges, with a savory spiciness."
Pondera 2011 Escapade Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Pondera,Red Blend,Escapade,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$45.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This unusual blend holds 57% Mourvèdre, 34% Syrah, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Malbec. It displays heaping amounts of black pepper along with aromas of dried herbs, vanilla and cherry. The style is elegant but with good concentration and a silky feel, with a tart uptick on the pepper and vanilla-filled finish."
Trinitas 2006 Pinot Blanc (Russian River Valley),Trinitas,Pinot Blanc,,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$20.0,,"Sometimes Pinot Blanc resembles Chardonnay, but this crisp, minerally, citrusy wine strikes a different pose. It does have a rich, creamy mouthfeel, which gives it a full-bodied mouthfeel, but it has a dry, steely character that makes it far friendlier with food than a fat, buttery Chard."
Disgruntled Mink 2001 Pinot Vert,Disgruntled Mink,Pinot Vert,,Fhloston Paradise,N A,US,4,$264.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Hogue 2012 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Hogue,Riesling,Late Harvest,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$11.0,Paul Gregutt,"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish."
Tudal 2009 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Tudal,Pinot Noir,Bacigalupi Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$50.0,,"The vineyard is in a warmer part of the valley, and the wine is a bit rustic, lacking some delicacy. But it has deeply delicious raspberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with earth and licorice notes elaborated by smoky oak. Give it a good, long decant."
Bellangelo 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Bellangelo,Cabernet Sauvignon,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$19.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"Smoky, elegant and soft aromas of leather, pepper and berry lead into flavors of cherry and cigarbox spice on the palate of this approachable Cabernet. The wine is not terribly complex, but good structure and acidity give it cellaring potential, and paired with duck, lamb or beef dishes, it will make a very nice addition to the table."
Dobbes Family Estate 2013 Patricia's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Dobbes Family Estate,Pinot Noir,Patricia's Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$55.0,Paul Gregutt,"Warm, roasted aromas beckon and engage your interest, while in the mouth, the wine puts a tart citrus frame around blue-plum and black-cherry fruit. Streaks of cola, earth and coffee bring further highlights."
Fulkerson 2016 Estate Rosé (Finger Lakes),Fulkerson,Rosé,Estate,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Intense bramble notes and a hint of earth lend savoriness to crisp red cherry and berry in this dry rosé. While delicate in concentration, refreshing acidity and brisk texture make this a lovely summer apéritif."
Feather 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Feather,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$60.0,Paul Gregutt,"Aggressive tannins and an unusually strong herbal component make this new vintage of Feather a bit difficult to assess at this moment. It's peppery and stemmy in the nose, earthy and tannic in the mouth, with suggestions of asparagus. Quite a change from past vintages, but perhaps just a stage in its further evolution."
Prime Solum 2013 Brokenrock Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),Prime Solum,Cabernet Franc,Brokenrock Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$79.0,Virginie Boone,"Dusty herb and cedar dot the landscape of this well-made, tiny-production wine, that shows plenty of varietal character. A juicy core of cassis is buoyed by tingling acidity, keeping the full-bodied character refreshing and food-friendly."
Alysian 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Clone 95 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Alysian,Chardonnay,Floodgate Vineyard Clone 95,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$40.0,,"This Chardonnay is made in a leaner, lower alcohol style. In place of the fat, rich fruit of some Chards you'll find a tart minerality, with the citrus and peach flavors containing hints of sweet green peas. Gains extra points for elegance."
Sheldrake Point 2015 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Sheldrake Point,Pinot Gris,Estate Bottled,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A vein of burnt sugar threads curiously from nose to finish in this dry full-bodied Pinot Gris. Sunny tangerine, pineapple and apricot flavors flood the midpalate, brightened by streak of lime acidity. A graceful balance of brawn and restraint, it should drink well through 2021."
Avennia 2013 Sestina Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Avennia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sestina,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,93,$65.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"More brains than brawn, the focus on this understated Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend is on old vines, with fruit coming mostly from early '70s and '80s Dionysus, Bacchus and Red Willow vineyard plantings. The earth, black cherry, peppercorn, currant and dried herb aromas start out tightly coiled. The flavors have laser-focused purity and a compelling sense of balance, with plenty of subtleties. It's all about nuance."
Lookout Ridge 2005 Andy Erickson Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Lookout Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,Andy Erickson,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$100.0,,"Erickson is the winemaker at Screaming Eagle, and he participated in this charitable project for Lookout Ridge. A blend of the two Cabernets, it's soft, unctuous and decadent, in the modern cult Napa style. Floods the mouth with pastry-filling blackberries, cherries, currants, cassis, chocolate and bacon. Drink now through 2010 for freshness."
Rutherford Hill 2013 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),Rutherford Hill,Cabernet Franc,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"This is a simple, soft and quite floral wine, showing a wealth of dusty tannin and full-bodied power. Cedar and pomegranate are the highlights that ride a textured wave of chalky oak."
River Road 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),River Road,Chardonnay,Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$16.0,Virginie Boone,"Fermented in both oak and stainless steel, this serviceable white is salty and smooth, with plenty of Gravenstein apple on offer. Lingering acidity keeps it crisp and refreshing, before there's a touch of buttery oak."
Bergevin Lane 2015 Linen Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Bergevin Lane,Sauvignon Blanc,Linen,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Kiwi, pineapple and herb aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors. The concentration isn't quite all there in the middle but it still provides enjoyment."
Arbor Brook 2008 Croft Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Arbor Brook,Pinot Gris,Croft Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"Fruit is sourced from a 23–year-old, organically farmed vineyard. With wonderful texture and mouthfeel, it offers a luscious mix of pear, pear skin, and grapefruit—tangy and refreshing. Such a juicy, spicy, lip-licking wine, you can't wait for the next sip."
Roco 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Roco,Chardonnay,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"At first sharp and showing the influence of barrel aging in roughly 20% new French oak, this opens up and smoothes out into a supple, buttery wine. It's rich with flavors of pineapple, baked apple, sweet spices and a hint of mint. Polished and sophisticated, it generously rewards your attention with plenty of delicious details."
Y Rousseau 2013 Old Vines Colombard (Russian River Valley),Y Rousseau,Colombard,Old Vines,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$20.0,Virginie Boone,"That 40-year-old Colombard even exists in the Russian River Valley is quite remarkable and so it's a worthy exercise to taste this wine for the sake of history and diversity alone. Happily it's also quite fresh in pineapple, pear and exotic lemongrass, textured throughout, dry and steely on the finish."
Passaggio 2011 Unmarked code seven Fagan Creek Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),Passaggio,Pinot Noir,Unmarked code seven Fagan Creek,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$45.0,,"Ripe and heavy, with raspberry and cherry jam, cola, green herb and oak flavors that finish spicy. The grapes are from Jameson Canyon, outside Calistoga. A good wine, but not going anywhere, so drink up."
Left Coast Cellars 2012 White Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Left Coast Cellars,Pinot Noir,White Pinot Noir,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$20.0,Paul Gregutt,"White seems to be the new black when it comes to Oregon Pinot Noir, as more and more winemakers give it a spin. This is one of the better ones, at a very modest price, mixing sweet grass and fresh pear and stone fruits. It would be difficult to identify it as Pinot Noir in a blind tasting of mixed whites, but that's not the point, is it?"
Treleaven 2012 Vintner's Cuvée Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Treleaven,Chardonnay,Vintner's Cuvée Barrel Fermented,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$30.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Crisp lime acidity counters a sunny, lemon-cream disposition in this lusciously composed Chardonnay. The palate is silky in texture, lingering long and luxuriously on the finish."
De Loach 2011 Ritchie Vineyard Middle Reach Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),De Loach,Chardonnay,Ritchie Vineyard Middle Reach,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$50.0,,"The Middle Reach is an informal name for the warmer, northern part of the valley that should have its own appellation. In this wine, you'll find elaborate apricot, tangerine, Meyer lemon and peach flavors, alongside brisk acidity and oak influences. It's a gorgeous wine for drinking soon."
Witness Tree 2010 Vintage Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Witness Tree,Pinot Noir,Vintage Select,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"Though it was given twice as many new French oak barrels as the Estate bottling, this Vintage Select could be its twin. Solid and balanced, it mixes berry, herb and earth components, making for a well-structured, no-frills wine."
Tedeschi Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Tedeschi Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,84,$58.0,,"Tastes tired, with dried out tannins framing blackberry and oak flavors. Interesting, but catch it now before it goes further downhill."
RiverAerie 2008 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),RiverAerie,Sangiovese,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,84,$16.0,Paul Gregutt,"Some sandalwood incense elevates the nose. In the mouth there is little varietal character, though the Sangiovese is unblended. Tart, chewy, acidic and light, with plenty of acid."
Elkhorn Ridge 2011 Le Terre Foss Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Elkhorn Ridge,Pinot Noir,Le Terre Foss,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$29.0,Paul Gregutt,"Possessing intensely floral aromatics, this distinctive wine also pulls in Asian spices, specifically curry. The fruit hangs on the light side of the red spectrum, with a dash of cherry candy."
Sanglier Cellars 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Sanglier Cellars,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$38.0,Jim Gordon,"A pure and distinctive fruit flavor, like a blend of rhubarb and blackberry, distinguishes this full-bodied but elegant and velvet-textured wine. There is little or no new oak influence to get in the way of the melody of the grapes themselves. While the wine is lush and broad in mouthfeel, a nice boost of fine tannins and fresh acidity keep it lively."
Crespi Ranch 2012 Mission Series Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Crespi Ranch,Pinot Noir,Mission Series,California,Russian River Valley,US,86,$22.0,Virginie Boone,"This is a light, clear and candied wine, somewhat thin, that's also tangy in acidity. Also holding 5% Zinfandel and 5% Sangiovese, it's definitely fruity in cherry and vanilla without getting overripe, a good value made by longtime winemaker Dr. Richard Peterson."
Damiani 2015 Pinot Grigio (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Pinot Grigio,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This bold, full-bodied white is a nifty showcase of Pinot Gris's unique duality. On the nose, it seems quite spry and cutting, wafting of crushed minerals, crisp green-apple skins and blossoms. The palate, however, is weighty and mouth filling, a testament to 30 days of maturation on its lees. It maintains its fresh, fruity flair and pleasantly sunny citrus acidity."
Buehler 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Buehler,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$25.0,Virginie Boone,"This is an impressive effort, especially at the price, which is kind of unheard of in these parts. Softened by 9% Merlot, it's rich and full-bodied without ever overdoing it, opaque in color with a nose of baked bread and flavors of raspberry and black currant. It's food-ready."
Redhawk 2010 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Redhawk,Pinot Noir,Vintner's Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"Light, but elegant and pretty, this wine spent 17 months in 40% new oak. Fruit flavors emphasize tart berry, with a dash of earthy sandalwood."
Blinking Lizard 2000 Tokaji,Blinking Lizard,Tokaji,,Mars,N A,US,208,$315.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Novelty Hill,Sauvignon Blanc,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand."
Keuka Spring 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Keuka Spring,Cabernet Sauvignon,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,83,$19.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"A candied nose of raspberry and pepper starts this wine out on a slightly clumsy note, but on the palate, the wine offers solid, if slightly simple, flavors. The finish impresses with its warm, spicy wave."
Brooklyn Winery 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Brooklyn Winery,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While intensely mineral and strikingly brisk with acidity, this delicate dry Riesing also boasts pretty notes of blossom, white peach and pear. It's a keenly four-square wine that's zingy, fresh and endlessly quaffable."
Carlisle 2014 Montafi Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Carlisle,Zinfandel,Montafi Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$47.0,Virginie Boone,"From a ranch planted originally in 1926 this is a knockout wine, exotically spiced and nuanced in pepper, cinnamon and a distinction of sandalwood. High-toned fruit provides a lift to the lushness that wants to dominate, but never does, allowing the tangy orange and blackberry to speak quietly and clearly."
Le Cadeau 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Le Cadeau,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$38.0,Paul Gregutt,"This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish."
Williams Selyem 2009 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Chardonnay,Heintz Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$50.0,,"Fat, oily, unctuous and honeyed. Shows massive pineapple, mango, tangerine and Asian pear fruit, with a savory spiciness and plenty of sweet, smoky oak. As ripe as it is, it's saved from simplicity by brilliant acidity, a mineral cleanliness, and a thoroughly dry finish."
Saviah 2013 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Saviah,Chardonnay,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$25.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Lees aromas mix with notes of custard, poached pear, cinnamon and well-integrated barrel accents. The palate shows a sense of finesse and grace that carries through the finish."
Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Walnut City WineWorks,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$21.0,Paul Gregutt,"Here's a round and fruity, ready-right-now Pinot Noir, anchored in strawberry fruit and lightly dusted with coffee grounds. The finish turns a bit stiff and stemmy."
Lost Canyon 2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lost Canyon,Pinot Noir,Dutton Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"Wafting baked bread aromas create a warm, inviting entry in this wine, which reveals medium-bodied layers of tart, tangy citrus, cranberry and pomegranate as it opens. High-toned yet deep, it offers balance and complexity and lingers on the finish."
Fulkerson 2009 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),Fulkerson,Pinot Noir,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Savory, rustic notes of dried mushroom and toasted nuts mingle with richly concentrated black-cherry and rose-petal flavors on this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Noir. Soft tannins and just a shade of toasted oak add richness and dimension to the palate."
Elk Cove 2012 Roosevelt Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Elk Cove,Pinot Noir,Roosevelt,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,95,$85.0,Paul Gregutt,"A star even among a stellar group of 2012 releases from Elk Cove, this 20-year-old vineyard really delivers the goods. Time has tempered the herbal aromatics, giving this rich, ripe effort a subtle subtext of olive and sage. Black cherry, dark chocolate and a dusty, mocha finish with a hint of habanero pepper bring this wine together beautifully. Delicious already, it should continue to improve 2025–2030."
White Springs 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),White Springs,Cabernet Sauvignon,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$18.0,,"Upon opening, this wine showed some funky low tones that blew off after a while to reveal an unusual mix of aromas, including cotton candy, stewed prunes and fresh nuts. The light-to-medium-bodied palate is more classic, with razor-like acidity and raspberry and cherry flavors. Delicious cherry-berry finish. Try with beef stew. Drink now."
Chehalem 2013 Three Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Chehalem,Pinot Noir,Three Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$32.0,Paul Gregutt,"This blend of the three estate vineyards is the first Pinot to be released from each vintage. Here it spent time in 22% oak, roughly half new. Cranberry, pomengranate, dried herbs and some gently earthy tannins combine in a tart, gulpable style."
Spring Mountain Vineyard 2005 Estate Syrah (Napa Valley),Spring Mountain Vineyard,Syrah,Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$55.0,,"From the estate vineyard on Spring Mountain comes this dense, powerful Syrah. It's a big wine, packed with black currants and chocolate and sturdy tannins that are a bit astringent right now. Yet the long finish, which turns up complex spices and olive tapenade and black pepper, suggests this wine has nowhere to go but up. Best after 2009."
Charles & Charles 2013 Post No. 35 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Charles & Charles,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Post No. 35,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (68%) and Syrah offers aromas of blue fruit, smoked meat, tire rubber and herbs. It's sweet and flavorful with abundant plum notes."
Brooks 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley),Brooks,Rosé,Pinot Noir,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"This generous rosé was whole-cluster pressed, yielding bright, fresh flavors of just-picked strawberries. The flavors are uplifted with a backing of wet stone minerality, and if any wine captures springtime in a bottle, this is it."
Patterson 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Patterson,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$40.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine from Klipsun and Alder Ridge vineyards—aged in 100% new French oak—offers notes of coffee, herbs, jammy fruit and green wood. Flavors are full, plummy and sugary-sweet backed by firm tannins and sharp-edged acids."
Wine Spots 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Wine Spots,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$25.0,,"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a négociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors."

Forgeron 2006 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Forgeron,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"The blend includes 2% Muscat, an experiment that may not be repeated, though it worked quite well, boosting the aromatics and adding pretty floral notes at the top. The fruit is solidly anchored in citrus, pear and peach; and the barrels add a pleasing toastiness to the finish. There's a hint of anise as well. Lovely balance and fullness throughout."
Patterson 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Patterson,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$32.0,Sean P. Sullivan,Aromas suggest red and blue fruit along with butterscotch and wood spice. The fruit flavors are sweet and rich with abundant woodspice accents and chewy tannins.
Meander 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Meander,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$65.0,,"Made in a drier, more elegant style than many other Napa Cabs, this polished bottling can be described as Bordeaux-esque. Its blackberry and currant flavors are grounded in a cedary structure of earth and herbs. Great for a wine list. Drink this fine wine now and through 2014."
Conti Costanti 2009 Pinot Vert,Conti Costanti,Pinot Vert,,Australia,NA,US,14,$3.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Venge 2012 Scout's Honor Red (Napa Valley),Venge,Red Blend,Scout's Honor,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$38.0,Virginie Boone,"In this big proprietary blend, winemaker Kirk Venge pits 70% Zinfandel and 14% Petite Sirah against 11% Charbono, a rare find in the Napa Valley, and 5% Syrah. The results are complex in deep cherry and milk chocolate, with plenty of grip and drinkable tannins, the finish soft and rich. This wine delivers a great value for the quality."

Ottimino Vineyards 2007 Von Weidlich Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Ottimino Vineyards,Zinfandel,Von Weidlich Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$36.0,,"Shows a delicate texture, almost Pinot Noir-like in lightness, yet offers a blast of berry, spice, tobacco, cola and bacon flavors that are lusty and ripe.

The Valour is a good place to start. It's a single vineyard, Hanzell clone, 100% whole cluster cuvée, bursting with warm fruit flavors of maraschino cherry. There's a light dash of white pepper and refreshing acidity, with a lick of minerality."

Iijima,Slightly muted tones of pressed apple and pear waft from this light-bodied Vidal Blanc. It's not a deeply concentrated or persistent wine but bright and quaffable.

Siduri 2012 Muirfield Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Siduri,Pinot Noir,Muirfield Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$42.0,Paul Gregutt,"This stubbornly tight, short, tart wine shows lightly spiced cherry fruit. But after being opened for some hours, the flavors seem to thin out quickly, leaving an impression of a wine that lacks concentration."
Shaw 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Shaw,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$35.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Aged four years in oak, this stately wine is adorned with layers of maple sugar, toast and smoked nuts, but its racy sour-cherry flavors shine through brightly. The backbone of this wine is taut with acidity, but bold, richly textured mouthfeel puts the palate at ease. It's sumptuous and revitalizing."
Clos Pegase 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Clos Pegase,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate Bottled,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$55.0,Virginie Boone,"This wine consists of all five red Bordeaux varieties plus 5% Syrah.

Stone Wolf 2012 Barrel Select Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Stone Wolf,Pinot Noir,Barrel Select Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$14.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is a toasty, tasty, forward and easy-drinking Pinot Noir.

Belle Vallée 2005 Port Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Belle Vallée,Pinot Noir,Port,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,82,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"Sugary, volatile, with flavors of prune and brown sugar. No finesse at all."

Lemony salt and a touch of stone complement the integrated, present oak, rewarded by a complex texture and finish."
King Estate 2015 Domaine Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),King Estate,Pinot Gris,Domaine,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$29.0,Paul Gregutt,"Now entitled to use the expanded Willamette Valley AVA, this estate-grown wine is broad, full-flavored and loaded with fruit.

Glenora 2013 Meritage (Finger Lakes),Glenora,Meritage,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$30.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While ripe on the nose and luscious in mouthfeel, this taut, nervy Bordeaux-style blend showcases sweet-tart pomegranate and cranberry flavors. It's a lean, but refreshing wine with a crisp finish."
Hartford 2007 Jennifer's Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Hartford,Pinot Noir,Jennifer's,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$65.0,,"One of the ripest of Hartford's new Pinots, this is a full-bodied and very rich wine. It offers extreme flavor in place of subtlety, offering a massive palate wash of blackberries and cherries that veers into Lifesaver candy. The bet is ageability. Hold until after 2011."
Ardenvoir 2007 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),Ardenvoir,Rosé,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$16.0,Paul Gregutt,"As one might expect, this is Washington rosé with a French touch, courtesy of consulting winemaker Christian LeSommer. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc, given a four-hour soak and then fermented in neutral oak, it is exceptional in every way. Silky and flavorful with a mix of peach and strawberry, vanilla cookie and amazing length."
La Crema 2015 Saralee's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),La Crema,Chardonnay,Saralee's Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"Opening with beautiful aromatics, this wine has a heady invitation of orange and apple blossom before revealing a sublime texture and rich oak. Pillowy on the palate, it offers Asian pear and apple flavors, with a slight confectionery quality of crème brûlée."
Maisonry 2012 Hudson Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Maisonry,Sauvignon Blanc,Hudson Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$32.0,,"The vineyard is in the Carneros district, which makes you wonder why the winery doesn't so identify it. The wine shows brisk, mouthwatering acidity and flavors that range from ripe tropical fruits through lemons and grapefruits to tart gooseberries."
Standing Stone 2001 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Riesling,Ice,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$32.0,Joe Czerwinski,"Smells rich and decadent, with aromas of orange marmalade and honey, but still maintains refreshing touches of citrus and pineapple throughout. It's thick and rich in the mouth, and finishes long, with excellent balance. This can easily compete with Canadian ice wines."
Buena Vista 2013 Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Buena Vista,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Buena Vista,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"A new offering from the Sonoma-based producer meant to recall the estate's original founding in the Napa Valley, this wine sources from across that appellation and impresses right away in its succulent and soft approach to the variety. With a backbone of cassis and vanilla, it's expansive and lengthy, velvety in texture and very satisfying."
Sineann 2006 Medici Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley),Sineann,Riesling,Medici Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is done in a style that walks the line between Kabinett and Spatlese; it's just 11% alcohol but the fruit sweetness is largely hidden behind the tangy natural acids. It's got the mixed fruit flavors of peach, apricot, citrus and even a hint of tropical, along with the edgy definition of citrus peel that gives it a crisp finish."
Swedish Hill 2005 Optimus Red (Finger Lakes),Swedish Hill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Optimus,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$25.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"Spicy red fruit and pepper lead on this Bordeaux blend from the Finger Lakes, and lively fruit flavors follow. Tannins, acid and oak are balanced and attractive, and the finish has length and structure. Overall, a wine with poise."
Barrister 2005 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Barrister,Cabernet Franc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"The fruit is perfectly ripe and succulent, a juicy mix of berries and black cherries. It's set against firm but ripe and polished tannins, which provide muscle and add some spice as well. The oak contributes just the right level of toast, not too heavy. The exceptional, sweet and tasty fruit takes the center stage, while the pretty oak flavors do the final curtain call."
Gård 2013 Lawrence Vineyards Grand Klasse Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),Gård,Rosé,Lawrence Vineyards Grand Klasse,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"Packaged in a sexy, Champagne-style bottle, this 100% Grenache is firm and substantial. It underscores fruit flavors of peach, apricot and melon with appealing minerality."
Elk Cove 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Elk Cove,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$18.0,Michael Schachner,"Very youthful, so the first aromas are of a wild field, with some cranberry. It’s a full-volume wine, with an appealing chunky forwardness but also bright acidity, style and character. In a word, it’s “balanced.” Will go with almost anything, from baked salmon to dark chocolate. A real pleaser, especially at this price point. Best Buy."
Catacula 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Catacula,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$11.0,,A straightforward wine that goes the extra mile to achieve richness and finesse. The citrusy flavors are expressive and intense. One of the best Sauvignon Blanc values you'll find.
VML 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),VML,Pinot Noir,Rosé of,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$20.0,Virginie Boone,"Tingling in acidity, this substantially juicy, full-bodied rosé is made from ripe fruit that leans toward flavors of strawberries and Russian River Valley Pinot's classic tell-tale of cherries. The aromas are floral; think Lady Day gardenia."
Tendril 2014 Extrovert Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Tendril,Pinot Noir,Extrovert,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$48.0,Paul Gregutt,"Built for immediate enjoyment, this brings a tasty mix of berries and cherries, rounded off with 15 months in one-year-old barrels. The delicious burst of mocha around the fruit is what propels this wine, and invites the second glass as soon as the first is finished."
Adair Bachman 2014 Rose & Thistle Rosé (Napa Valley),Adair Bachman,Rosé,Rose & Thistle,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"This is made from 92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Pinot Noir, an interesting and fulfilling combination thats robust on the palate.

Trathen Hall 2012 Antiquum Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Trathen Hall,Pinot Noir,Antiquum Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$48.0,Paul Gregutt,"From a blending of two barrels—one new and one neutral—this is a snappy, sappy, tangy wine with ripe, forward red and purple fruits. These notes are framed with pretty barrel toast, and the tannins are firm, ripe and balanced. Drink now with pleasure or tuck it away until 2020."
Goose Ridge 2013 Estate Bottled GRV White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Goose Ridge,White Blend,Estate Bottled GRV,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$24.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is half Viognier with the rest Grenache Blanc and Roussanne. It offers aromas of almond, lees and peach. It's unctuous in feel but lighter in style with a touch of bitterness that distracts."
Chateauneuf-du-Pape 2020 Champagknee,Chateauneuf-du-Pape,Champagknee,,New York,,US,26,$162.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
O•S Winery 2011 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),O•S Winery,Riesling,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"Winemaker Bill Owen consistently produces one of Washington's most stylish Rieslings. High in acid and low in alcohol, the sweet-tart balance of the wine is exciting and perfectly rendered. Despite a change in vineyard sources, this remains rich, round and juicy, with flavors of peach, apricot and a hint of fresh cream."
Hestan 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Hestan,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$155.0,Virginie Boone,"This wine has a classic personality: round and soft in tannin, with a chalkiness lurking behind herbal tobacco leaf, tomato, cedar and rose notes. Full-bodied, it doesn't hold back on ripeness but displays more savory character than fruit."
Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,Sauvignon Blanc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$13.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"Honey, flower and melon leads on this delicate Riesling from Hazlitt.

Sinatra Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Sinatra Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,95,$95.0,,"Representing a breathtaking advancement over the '07, Sinatra's 2008 Cab is simply delicious. It's fleshy and fat in texture, with a glyceriney richness that makes it almost oily and that, when combined with caramelized oak, turns into nougat. The blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavors rise to the occasion. This is truly a stunningly good Cabernet."
Damiani 2014 Dry Rhysling Riesling (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Riesling,Dry Rhysling,New York,Finger Lakes,US,91,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While demure on the nose, this dry Riesling offers a palate that is surprisingly bold in both flavor and textural intensity. Bursts of ripe grapefruit and tangerine flavors are accented by a kiss of rose-petal perfume. Zesty orange-peel notes lend a touch of astringency to the finish."
Hedges 1999 Fume Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Hedges,Chardonnay,Fume,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$9.0,Paul Gregutt,"A wonderful nose mixes pineapple/tropical fruits, honeysuckle and some spicy herbs. The crisp and clean flavors are of green berries, melon and vanilla. Best Buy."
Galerie 2013 Pleinair Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Galerie,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pleinair,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"A reduction of tar and meaty leather at first overrides elusive fruit in this 100% varietal wine. It's alluring nonetheless, for its soft tannins and toasted hits of oak. Currant, clove and tobacco give a savory, compelling and complex edge to the full-bodied frame."
Peju 2015 Rosé (Napa Valley),Peju,Rosé,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$25.0,Virginie Boone,"This proprietary blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and Malbec satisfies, offering a crisp, creamy layering of strawberry and grapefruit atop a medium-sized body and salty, tangy finish."
Whitestone 2005 Lake Roosevelt Shores Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Whitestone,Merlot,Lake Roosevelt Shores Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,83,$28.0,Paul Gregutt,"Soft and supple, this quite approachable wine has simple, lightly fruity flavors. It's generic, pleasant and ready to drink, with some milk chocolaty oak in the finish. Though it lists at 14.6% alcohol, it does not have commensurate weight or density of flavor."
Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 2nd Degree Medium Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),Four Degrees of Riesling,Riesling,2nd Degree Medium Sweet,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Lush and tropical with rich, ripe streaks of pineapple and mango, this medium-sweet Riesling is unabashedly forward and fruity, but hints of earth and dust on the midpalate lend a dark tone. Light on its feet, with a lemony finish."
Rooster Hill 2007 Estate Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Rooster Hill,Gewürztraminer,Estate,New York,Finger Lakes,US,80,$16.0,,"While the aromas show some promise, they are disappointingly faint for a Gewürztraminer. This wine is an easy quaffer but lacks the palate richness typical of this variety. Crisp acidity and low alcohol (11.7%) make it a good hot weather choice."
Territorial 2013 Equinox Vineyard Spoiled Rotten Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Territorial,Chardonnay,Equinox Vineyard Spoiled Rotten,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,93,$60.0,Paul Gregutt,"Lush candied fruits abound in this naturally botrytised wine. With 147 g/L of residual sugar, it still reaches over 12% alcohol. Pineapple, lemon and orange peel, pine resin, honey, cedar and butterscotch are all in the mix, plus a lot more. You can go spelunking in this wine and never see it all."
Carlton Hill 2011 Estate Pinot Noir,Carlton Hill,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"This graceful wine, from a cool vintage, nicely expresses the more elegant side of Pinot Noir. There are ample fruit flavors of plum, cherry and blueberry, and a pleasantly musky note overlays the maturing fruit. It's rolling along smoothly into a fully integrated finish. Drink now through 2020."
Gary Farrell 2014 Russian River Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Gary Farrell,Chardonnay,Russian River Selection,California,Russian River Valley,US,95,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"Dark yellow in color, this wine shows tangy green apple and a richer, more concentrated element of apple-spice cake, with supportive, balanced acidity. With a bright, lifted finish, this less-expensive offering compared with many of the producer's single-vineyard designates never lets up on complexity or deliciousness."
Lynmar 2010 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Chardonnay,Quail Hill Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,95,$40.0,,"A bone dry wine that's rich in steely minerals and wonderful acidity. It offers the elegance and complexity of a great premier cru, with tantalizing traces of sweet Meyer lemons, limes and exotic spices. The oak is subtle, lending aromas and flavors of buttered toast, while its time spent on the lees contributes notes of sour cream. A fabulous success for this or any vintage."
Chasseur 2014 Soft Asylum Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Chasseur,Pinot Noir,Soft Asylum,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"Thinly textured and lightly spiced, this wine shows an earthy forest-floor character with spikes of baking spice and black tea.

Burnt Bridge 2011 Pont Brûlé Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Burnt Bridge,Red Blend,Pont Brûlé,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is 58% Grenache, 39% Syrah, and 3% Tempranillo. It's a real fruit salad of a wine—fresh and loaded with strawberries, cherry candy, cola and cream. Forward and fruit-driven, it's enormously appealing and ready to drink right now."
Used Automobile Parts 2004 Red (Napa Valley),Used Automobile Parts,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$50.0,,"The question is whether or not this wine will age, for it sure is tannic. Burns from entry to exit, and it's not the alcohol, which is modest. It's a very ripe, fruity Bordeaux blend, brimming with blackberry, cherry, licorice and cola flavors, and is flat-out delicious, except for those astringent tannins. Give it until sometime in 2008, and it should drink well for an additional six years."

Thick, dense and robust in tannin and oak, it offers structured red and black fruit, dried herb, pencil lead, cedar and cigar, combining ripeness with cooler-climate characteristics. It should cellar well through 2021."

Iijima,"Opulent layers of quince, apple and tangerine seem to be glazed with honey­comb and smoke in this complex, textured wine. Dry in style, it's satisfyingly creamy on the palate, yet struck by a nervous edge of lime zest and lemony acidity. Drink now–2025 to allow its mineral complexities to deepen."
Coeur de Terre 2014 Abby's Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Coeur de Terre,Pinot Noir,Abby's Block Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$65.0,Paul Gregutt,"Lovely aromatics suggest wet stone, raspberry and pomegranate. This is a sleek, subtle wine. Its winery notes suggest it is a “slow bloomer” in the glass, which proves out if you give it that chance. It's balanced and resonant, with the promise of further improvement with another few years of bottle age."
Honor Winery 2012 Highest Honor Red (Napa Valley),Honor Winery,Red Blend,Highest Honor,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$89.0,Virginie Boone,"This big-bottled, wax-topped wine blends half Merlot with a quarter each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.

Wagner 2008 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Wagner,Gewürztraminer,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Although subdued both aromatically and on the palate, this refreshing, dry Gewürztraminer smells sweetly of waxy white florals and lemons with a hint of bruised apples. There's not a lot of concentration of flavor, but its fresh apple and lemon flavors are clean and brisk, ending with a pleasant grapefruit pith finish."
Wild Meadows 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Wild Meadows,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,81,$11.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas of blueberry, milk chocolate and tire rubber are pleasant enough but the palate distracts with sweet, lightly spritzy blue fruit flavors backed by chalky tannins."
Corley 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),Corley,Pinot Noir,Estate Grown,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$58.0,,"This is Corley's first Pinot Noir since 1999 and it's delicious. Grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District, it shows Pinot's opulent side, with a silky, velvety texture framing ripe cherry pie, red currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors. Best now through 2010."
Apex 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Apex,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$30.0,Sean P.

Novelty Hill 2014 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Novelty Hill,Merlot,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$28.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine's milk chocolate, herb, cherry, barrel spice and plum aromas lead to a plush, soft palate loaded with chocolate and plum flavors. It strikes a lovely balance."

Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas."
Sean Minor 2009 Red (Napa Valley),Sean Minor,Red Blend,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$22.0,,"There's something distinguished about this blend of several varieties, but also something one-dimensional.

McClelland,Charbono,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$40.0,Virginie Boone,"In association with winemaker Mitch Cosentino, John McClelland—former president and general manager of Almaden, Geyser Peak and Alderbrook—has crafted a velvety and robust 100% Charbono.

Abiqua Wind 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Abiqua Wind,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$12.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is a bright, spicy, crisply defined wine, and an overall supervalue.

William Knuttel 2007 Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),William Knuttel,Pinot Noir,Clone 777,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$30.0,,"A textbook Pinot Noir for drinking now.

Domaine Serene 2008 Yamhill Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Domaine Serene,Pinot Noir,Yamhill Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$42.0,Paul Gregutt,"Drinkable now, but certainly cellar-worthy, the most widely available cuvée from Domaine Serene shows the strength of the 2008 vintage. Fully ripe, assertive and full-bodied, it brings scents of berry and herb into play, leading into a thick and tannic wine with coiled power. Decant it, or give it a few years in the cellar."

Benessere 2008 Phenomenon Red (Napa Valley),Benessere,Red Blend,Phenomenon,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$50.0,,"There is a ton of black pepper flavor in this stylish blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah. It also bears notes of licorice, sweet red currants, grilled prosciutto and sandalwood. This tastes so rich that it almost seems sweet, but it's actually dry and balanced."

Donum 2005 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Donum,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,83,$65.0,,"Harsh and disjointed, this Pinot has a hot, prickly feeling. It tastes unevenly ripened, with minty flavors side by side with Lifesaver candy, raspberries and red currants."
Anthill 2005 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Anthill,Pinot Noir,Tina Marie Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$43.0,,"The vineyard is in Green Valley, the coolest part of the appellation. You'll find very high acidity and an austere, elegant wine in this extremely low-yield Pinot Noir. The flavors are right on the edge, balancing less ripe peppermint and tannic Chinese-tea notes with richer cherries and raspberries. This is really a thrilling young wine, and while it may hold for years, it's best now for its tense youth."
Cellars 33 2013 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Cellars 33,Zinfandel,Bacigalupi Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$36.0,Virginie Boone,"Piquant in allspice, this soft, single-vineyard designate from a property known for Pinot Noir conveys a sense of elegance and subdued tannins, offering plum and red cherry atop shy waves of cedar and sage.

C. Beck 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),C. Beck,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$48.0,,"Inky dark and tannic now, this 100% Cabernet, aged in 50% new French oak barrels, seems aimed for the cellar. It's tough as nails now, but has an enormous heart of cassis. Give this low-production wine a good 4–6 years of aging."
Red Newt Cellars 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Red Newt Cellars,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While dainty in style, this refreshing Riesling is chock full of white-grapefruit flavor accented by a flurry of white florals, lime and lanolin. Concentrated but fresh, the palate bristles with striking acidity and minerality."
Raymond 2007 Generations Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Raymond,Cabernet Sauvignon,Generations,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$85.0,,"This is the darkest, biggest, richest of Raymond's 2007 Cabernets. It's ripe and full in blackberries and currants, with a thick coating of sweet, toasty oak, but it's not really drinkable now because the tannins are so strong. Designed for the cellar, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 10–12 years."
Joseph Jewell 2013 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Joseph Jewell,Pinot Noir,Hallberg Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"This comes from a dry-farmed site, all the better to coax out its stony minerality and delicate aromas of rose garden an d geranium.

Joseph Phelps 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Joseph Phelps,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$58.0,,"Expensive, yes, but it shows the drama and interest that a Joseph Phelps Cabernet predictably delivers. It's rich and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors, with wonderful tannins and a dry finish. Best now."
Tobacco Road 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Tobacco Road,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$65.0,Virginie Boone,"Rich and velvety on the palate, this Pinot is cohesive in soft, pretty layers of light spice and red raspberry and cherry.

Arista 2013 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Arista,Chardonnay,Ritchie Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"An opulent nose surges from the bottle in this lush, exuberant wine from the legendary vineyard site. Pronounced flavors of baked apple, caramel, honey and peach combine in memorable, full-bodied ways. Textured and layered, this brooder is drinking great now but should do well with more time in the cellar, through 2023."
Jarvis 2009 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),Jarvis,Merlot,Estate Grown,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$95.0,,"Made using grapes grown in Jarvis's mountain vineyard, this is a strongly flavored Merlot. It's brilliant and intense, with flavors of red cherry pie, red licorice, grilled Canadian bacon and sandalwood. The tannic structure is a joy—soft, furry and complex. There's lots of oak, too, which lends a smoky edge. Probably at its best now, so drink up."

Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2010 Merlot (Finger Lakes),Chateau Lafayette Reneau,Merlot,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$19.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A faint whiff of herbs linger from nose to palate, adding earthy complexity to tart sour-cherry and cranberry flavors. It's crisp and invigorating, but a little restrained in character. Finishes on a pleasantly tannic, brambly note."
Keuka Lake Vineyards 2014 Estate Grown and Bottled Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Keuka Lake Vineyards,Riesling,Estate Grown and Bottled Semi-Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$17.0,Anna Lee C.

Trisaetum 2012 Coast Range Estate Riesling,Trisaetum,Riesling,Coast Range Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$24.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder.

Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Whole Cluster,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,Carbonic maceration is the fermentation technique employed in this wine.

HKG 2011 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),HKG,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$28.0,,"Grassy dill and citrus flavors give this Chardonnay a Sauvignon Blanc-style leanness, but it's balanced with notes of buttered toast and vanilla from new French oak. Brisk with acidity, it's the perfect wine to drink with scallops."
Lucas Vineyards 2013 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Lucas Vineyards,Gewürztraminer,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$14.0,Anna Lee C.

Sullivan,"This blend of 43% Merlot, 26% Petit Verdot, 22% Carmenère, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Syrah offers orange peel, herb, raspberry and spice aromas that don't seem entirely knit together.

Mayo 1998 Piner Ranch Vyd Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Mayo,Pinot Noir,Piner Ranch Vyd,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$35.0,Joe Czerwinski,"Richer and denser than Mayo’s Sangiacomo bottling, this one also seems more marked by oak, with vanilla, menthol and toast aromas all riding over black cherries. In the mouth, the fruit really comes forward; there’s impressive depth and body here, and a lushness that’s balanced by a long finish with fresh acidity. Should age for up to 5 years—maybe more. Only problem? Finding some. There were only 100 cases produced."
Hermann J. Wiemer 2008 Magdalena Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Hermann J. Wiemer,Riesling,Magdalena Vineyard Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$36.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"From its bright floral nose to its soft, sweet finish, there's a gorgeous femininity to this outstanding Riesling.

This vintage is on the money in terms of style, going for a timeless, elegantly lean wine with dense tannins and plenty of vibrancy. Cranberry, black tea and a tease of green olive mark the entry, before denser elements of coffee and tobacco feature on the finish. Cellar through 2021."

Silverado 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),Silverado,Merlot,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$32.0,,"Silverado's Merlot has been variable over the years. This '04 is fruit-driven, a soft, direct and appealing wine for its wealth of blackberry, cherry, plum, chocolate and leather flavors.

McGregor 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),McGregor,Pinot Noir,Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$30.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This wine highlights heady new-oak tones of spice, vanilla and cedar, yet maintains elegance from nose to finish. Ripe black cherry and plum flavors penetrate on the palate, with a framing of soft tannins and bright cranberry acidity. The finish is long and a touch mineral."
William Knuttel 2013 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),William Knuttel,Chardonnay,Bacigalupi Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$38.0,Virginie Boone,"An intensely concentrated white from the famous historic vineyard, this youthful wine shows toasted oak around a palate-coating flirtation with tropical flavor, finding a supportive streak of minerality as it develops in the glass."
Silver Thread 2008 Blackbird Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Silver Thread,Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon,Blackbird,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$22.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Smoke and bramble fringe vibrant cassis and cranberry flavors on this rich, round wine. Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, it's a touch plush and soft, but boasts supple tannins and an elegant violet and vanilla finish."
Balletto 2012 Sexton Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Balletto,Chardonnay,Sexton Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Estate Bottled,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$38.0,Virginie Boone,"A wine given ample time in bottle, this exhibits a fair amount of ripe fruit and honeyed oak and vanilla. The generous offering of apple fritter and crème brûlée retains enough minerality in the background to stay balanced and refined."
Bowman Cellars 2015 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Bowman Cellars,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$34.0,Virginie Boone,"This wine is smooth and densely packed in earth and blackberry, the overall tone voluptuously concentrated and full bodied, with a tenacious embrace of ripeness."
Broadley 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Broadley,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"Certainly a remarkable value, this brings concentrated flavors of ripe raspberry and cherry liqueur into a big, broad and deep midpalate. The exuberance and depth of fruit is astonishing, and the balancing acidity suggests that the wine will retain its freshness through 2020 and beyond. This is one to buy by the case."
Ravines 2008 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Ravines,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$19.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Winemaker Morten Hallgren harnesses a traditional Italian grape-drying technique called appassimento to create this richly concentrated but dry Chardonnay. Initial notes of smoke and roasted hazelnut skins fade on the nose and palate to reveal a clean, fresh apple and pear character, speckled with white flowers and a bright lemon-lime acidity."
Caterina 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Caterina,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,84,$19.0,,"This honest effort at a terroir-driven Cabernet starts with currant and blackberry aromas, although they’re a little on the weak side. Nice berry and spice flavors with a dash of wood. High acidity gives it a real bite, and it finishes a little sharp as well."
Williams Selyem 2014 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Chardonnay,Allen Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,95,$58.0,Virginie Boone,"Allen Vineyard grapes have the maturity and complexity to impart a boldly balanced roundness of lemon curd, fig and apple, plus a searing undercurrent of salty minerality. With substantial weight, and texture for miles, it remains bright and fresh in the glass, with a lingering impression of cinnamon toast."
Atwater 2014 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Atwater,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While the nose suggests more dusty mineral than fruit, the palate of this off-dry Riesling offers loads of concentrated tangerine, lemon and apple flavors. It's juicy and ripe yet keenly balanced by a penetrating backbone of lemon-lime acidity. Drink now through 2021."
Tandem 2006 Lorenzo Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Tandem,Chardonnay,Lorenzo Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$42.0,,"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak."
Robert Weil 2007 Merlot,Robert Weil,Merlot,,France,N A,US,200,$96.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Atwater 2013 White Birch Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Atwater,Pinot Gris,White Birch Vineyards,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Juicy pineapple, mango and citrus notes lend a tropical feel to this penetrating, yet light bodied, Pinot Gris. Off dry in style, it's dancingly light on its feet, with a revitalizing shower of acidity that lingers through the finish."
Wagner 2015 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Wagner,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fresh and fragrant, this apple-scented Riesling offers loads of brisk lemon-lime flavors augmented by a subtle vein of smoke.

Standing Stone 2015 Old West Block Riesling (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Riesling,Old West Block,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$22.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Sunny orange and apricot aromas are accented with hints of smoke and nuts on the nose of this spry dry Riesling. The palate turns a shade zestier, suggesting cutting grapefruit and lemon dusted with pollen. It finishes long and clean."
Snoqualmie 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Snoqualmie,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$10.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This appealing, easy drinker offers notes of vanilla and pear. It's ripe and sweet, fleshy in feel with flavors that lean toward the tropical."
Regale Winery and Vineyards 2008 O'Neel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Regale Winery and Vineyards,Pinot Noir,O'Neel Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$48.0,,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years."
Cali 351 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cali 351,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$45.0,,"This is a very rich, and perhaps ageable, Cabernet Sauvignon, made with one-fifth Cabernet Franc. Grown from Calistoga grapes, it's soft enough to drink now, with chocolaty flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and mint. Lots of new oak adds caramel and smoky vanilla, but the wine is powerful enough to handle them. Give it through 2010 to integrate."
Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$19.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"With layers of coffee, spice and cedar enveloping scents of ripe black fruit and bramble, Hazlitt's Cab is beautifully composed on the nose. It's lean in style and body, however, with a black plum palate marked by whiffs of sweet tomato and green leaves on the finish."
Tedeschi 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Tedeschi,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,83,$45.0,,"With a ruby-clear color and a light mouthfeel, this low-alcohol Pinot also is a little light in flavor. The cherries and red currants are compromised by a problematic mushroom taste."
Shared Notes 2012 Les Pierres Qui Decident Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Shared Notes,Sauvignon Blanc,Les Pierres Qui Decident,California,Russian River Valley,US,89,$65.0,Jim Gordon,"A rare style of California white, this is made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, but is not labeled that way. Striking smoky, white-pepper aromas and aggressive dried herb flavors jangle with apparent oak character. The combination of sharp acidity and soothing body begins to come together on the finish. It needs time to mellow and may improve after 2015."
Carlo Rossi 2012 Genmaicha,Carlo Rossi,Genmaicha,,France,,US,93,$284.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Krutz 2014 Magnolia Inspiration Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Krutz,Chardonnay,Magnolia Inspiration Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$25.0,Virginie Boone,"There's a chalky tartness to this young wine, a single-vineyard designate from a consistent source. Gravenstein apple and a suggestion of honey star on the nose and palate around a medium body and finish."
Korbel 2013 Natural Sparkling (Russian River Valley),Korbel,Sparkling Blend,Natural,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$16.0,Virginie Boone,"This is a voluptuous sparkling blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay that is made methode Champenoise. Spritzy on the palate with a freshness of acidity, it offers a balanced blend of green apple and strawberry."
Titus Andronicus 2008 Pinoooooooot Noir,Titus Andronicus,Pinoooooooot Noir,,Washingtonne,NA,US,139,$237.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Lundeen 2012 Dennison Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Lundeen,Chardonnay,Dennison Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$28.0,Paul Gregutt,"Barrel-fermented in neutral oak, this is a ripe, creamy wine with mix of pineapple and buttered nuts. The secondary fermentation was stopped at 50%, leaving generous acidity and balancing out the intensity of the fruit. This wine punches above its price weight, and will drink well now through 2020."
Apsara 2013 Kenefick Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Apsara,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kenefick Ranch,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$70.0,Virginie Boone,"Now winemaker for Swanson, Robin Ackhurst excels here in this tiny production of his own wine, which exhibits exotic plum and juicy blackberry. A 100% varietal offering, it has a girth of structured tannin and toasty oak."
Williams Selyem 2010 30th Anniversary Cuvée Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,30th Anniversary Cuvée Estate Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,97,$125.0,,"This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley."
Le Cadeau 2014 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Le Cadeau,Pinot Noir,Diversité,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,93,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) makes this cuvée for Le Cadeau, and it's a triumph in this vintage. Cherry fruit ripe to the point of syrup hogs the flavor spotlight, but there's cranberry and raspberry too, putting a tangy note into the mix. Root beer and sweet cola elements combine, and there is little doubt that, good as it is already, this is a wine to cellar. Drink now–2028."
Napa Family Vineyards 2004 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley),Napa Family Vineyards,Merlot,Reserve,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$10.0,,"This wine would be a great value even for more money. It's bone dry, soft and extremely balanced, with cherry, black currant, plum and carob flavors that are grounded with a nice, sweet edge of fresh herbs and tobacco."
Anthony Nappa 2010 Luminous Riesling (Finger Lakes),Anthony Nappa,Riesling,Luminous,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Winemaker Anthony Nappa sources grapes from Finger Lakes notable Sheldrake Point to make this beautifully textured off-dry Riesling. It's fragrant and fresh, with hints of waxy lemon skins, tangerines and white blossoms, and the palate is rich, with lush stone-fruit and a deliciously astringent tea-leaf finish."
Willamette Valley Vineyards 2006 Hannah Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Hannah Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"Hannah vineyard is a select block of Tualatin Estate, and carries the same set of herbal, pine needle aromatics. But the fruit is more intense, with deeper cranberry and raspberry flavors, more weight and a stiffer finish. The time in barrel adds clove and cinnamon to the mix. Tannins are ripe and hard, so give this some extra time to breathe."
Boedecker Cellars 2007 Purity Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Boedecker Cellars,Chardonnay,Purity,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"The name refers to the fact that the wine was both fermented and aged in stainless steel barrels. Made with Dijon clones from two different vineyards, it's fruit-driven, nicely flavored, offering melon, apple and white peach in equal proportion. It's a well-balanced wine, with clean, fresh flavors and just the right amount of acid to keep you reaching for the next glass."
Bloomer Creek 2011 Unfined & Unfiltered Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Bloomer Creek,Chardonnay,Unfined & Unfiltered,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Savory tones of pressed apple and pear contrast with pretty orange-blossom aromas on this unusually light-footed Chardonnay. A blend of equal parts oak and stainless-steel ferment, it's concentrated with pear and lemon flavors. Finishes a bit short."
Paul Masson 2009 Data Join,Paul Masson,Data Join,,Fhloston Paradise,NA,US,72,$226.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Silverado 2013 Miller Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Silverado,Sauvignon Blanc,Miller Ranch,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$22.0,Virginie Boone,"Light, lemony and crisp, this refreshing wine has some layers of complex herb midpalate and remains bright in acidity through the finish. From both the Miller Ranch in Yountville and Soda Creek Vineyard."
Scott Family 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Scott Family,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$30.0,Virginie Boone,"Soft and simple, this full-bodied effort shows a char of toasted oak as strong flavors of root beer and cola meet dark cherry and berry."

Big DeVine 2014 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Big DeVine,Red Blend,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$15.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is a blend of Malbec (69%) and Syrah. Aromas of plum and spice lead to a plump, flavorful palate full of fruit flavors."

Bergevin Lane 2008 Calico White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Bergevin Lane,White Blend,Calico White,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$16.0,Paul Gregutt,"The Calico White is one of the state's most popular white blends, and is moving step by step toward an all-Rhône effort, now 44% Viognier 37% Roussanne, and just 19% Chardonnay. Winemaker Steffan Jorgensen deftly blends vineyards and AVAs to craft a refreshing, lightly-oaked wine with lime, lemon, pale peach and quinine."
Lakewood 2010 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Lakewood,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"On the nose and palate, notes of smoke and roasted nuts add earthy tones to the touches of crisp apple and lemon. It's dry and full bodied, with a round, soft fruitiness on the finish."
Guardian 2007 Conner Lee Vineyard Gun Metal Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Guardian,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Conner Lee Vineyard Gun Metal Red,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$37.0,Paul Gregutt,"The fruit is ripe and the tannins firm; winemaker Jerry Reiner is able to craft very ripe fruit while keeping the varietal character of the Cabs—earth and herb, with a touch of stem. Deep and substantial, this should age well for a decade or more."
Ballentine 2010 Pocai Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),Ballentine,Merlot,Pocai Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$25.0,,"This red wine might just make you purr with satisfaction. It delivers everything you want in a Merlot. It's dry, but soft, with plush tannins and rich flavors ranging from red cherries and currants to cocoa, violets and cedar."
Siduri 2012 Parsons' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Siduri,Pinot Noir,Parsons' Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$49.0,Virginie Boone,"Damp forest floor give this wine a strong character of earthiness and wintery, savory notes, surrounded by intense black cherry, oak and firm, sizable tannins. Enjoyable now, the wine also shows promise for the future, able to relax through 2020."
Trisaetum 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Trisaetum,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$36.0,Paul Gregutt,"This blend of the three estate vineyards opens with lightly musky aromas and pinpoint herbal highlights. The fruit rolls from cranberry to strawberry to cherry, and the wine has a slightly woody character. Tannins are proportionate, still a bit stiff, and showing leafy notes. A light suggestion of chocolate infuses the finish."
Emblem 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Emblem,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"Tight, juicy and tannic on the entry, this wine is medium bodied and layered in dusty oak, chocolate and black cherry. Lush and not overly oaked, it's a good choice for the table and for fans of Napa Valley ripeness."
Sheldrake Point 2014 Estate Bottled Riesling (Finger Lakes),Sheldrake Point,Riesling,Estate Bottled,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Swirls of honey melt into ripe, rich pink grapefruit and peach in this decadently fruity Riesling.

Maryhill 2009 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Cabernet Sauvignon,Proprietor's Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"The reserve takes the tight focus and black fruit flavors of the regular Cab and ramps them up a notch or two. Deeper, denser and darker, with flavors of cassis and licorice wrapped into the tannic, earthy depths of the finish. This has great power."
St. Clement 2005 Oroppas Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),St. Clement,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oroppas,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$55.0,,"This bottling from Napa veteran St. Clement has been variable in recent years. The '05 is similar to the '02. It's a likeable, elegant Cab that drinks well now. The cherry, blackberry, plum and mocha flavors are wrapped into rich, soft tannins."
Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Great Oak Vineyard Suicide Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Joseph Swan Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Great Oak Vineyard Suicide Hill,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"This wine is produced in microscopic amounts, the result of sourcing grapes from a notoriously difficult-to-farm site. It rewards in flavor: hearty cherry and pomegranate fruit, a crisp, crunchy texture, powerful tannins and oak, and an underlying minerality that presents as elusively as a cloud of fog."
Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Honeywood Winery,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$24.0,Paul Gregutt,"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer."
Knapp 2009 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Knapp,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Sweetened with a concentration of juicy, ripe pineapple and tropical fruit on both the nose and palate, this is an uncomplicated and fruity off-dry Riesling. A tart, zingy acidity balances the sweetness on the finish."
Left Coast Cellars 2012 Suzanne's Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Left Coast Cellars,Pinot Noir,Suzanne's Estate Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"The aromatics shine here, sending up a happy mix of ripe cherries and baking spices. The fruit carries the midpalate, with medium density and appealing, though blocky, flavors. This is not a complex wine, but most enjoyable."
Love & Squalor 2014 Sunnyside Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley),Love & Squalor,Riesling,Sunnyside Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$28.0,Paul Gregutt,"The vineyard was planted in 1971; the old vines apparently didn't ripen all that well, as the finished wine, though dry, is only 11% alcohol. It's an odd bottle all around, with very low pH (2.77), tart and diffuse fruit, and no telltale markers for the variety. Two bottles tasted with similar results."
Stony Lonesome 2013 Estate Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),Stony Lonesome,Sauvignon Blanc,Estate Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Demure on the nose with hints of dust, smoke and dried herbs, this is a dry, decidedly savory style of Sauvignon Blanc. It's crisp and spry on the palate with pleasant lemon-lime flavors, but finishes briskly."
BonAnno 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),BonAnno,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,85,$20.0,,"Sharp, simple and candied, with blackberry jam and cola flavors. The tannins are rugged, and the wine finishes with a scour of acidity. Seems at its best now."
Fidelitas 2006 Optu Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Fidelitas,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Optu Red Wine,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"The Optu red is packaged in a supremely heavy, oversized glass bottle, suggesting that this is the winery's prestige blend, as does the name, Latin for “the best.” Big, full, rich, ripe, round, fleshy and forward, this is a no-wait red that should be consumed as soon as possible."
Davis Family 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Davis Family,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$38.0,Virginie Boone,"Dark gold in color and mightily textured, this lovely wine is medium-bodied and salty in pear, mango an pineapple. The flavors are subdued and nuanced, finding their way within layers of acidity and refined oak."
J. Wright 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),J. Wright,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"Lovely aromas meld rose petals and raspberries, while flavors convey sweet cherries with a dash of chocolate. Light hints of leaf and stem add complexity to the midpalate, and a hint of bacon surprises and delights in the finish."
Kontos 2013 Gossamer White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Kontos,White Blend,Gossamer,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$26.0,Paul Gregutt,"Lively and full-bodied, the blend includes Chardonnay, Marsanne, Roussanne and Pinot Gris. Citrus fruits fill the mouth, with a streak of honey and appealing roundness. This is a great wine to just drink and enjoy, without too much contemplation."
River Road 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),River Road,Chardonnay,Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,86,$19.0,,"This presents the opulence that many Chardonnay fans enjoy. It bears flavors of caramel, orange, pineapple, tapioca, vanilla, honey and cinnamon, which are wrapped in a creamy texture."

Joseph Swan Vineyards 2008 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Joseph Swan Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Trenton Estate Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$52.0,,"The vineyard is in a very cool, damp part of the valley, and this particular bottling always shows a dry finish, considerable tannins and an earthiness not found in warmer parts of the appellation. This 2008 follows those lines. It has a dense core of sour cherry candy fruit, with some superripe currants. Will age interestingly over the decade."
M. Trinchero 1997 Founder's Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),M. Trinchero,Cabernet Sauvignon,Founder's Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$40.0,,"Plummy aromas, black-cherry and oak, and accents of vanilla and cream. It's tight now, fairly begging for time to unfold. Presently the cherry core borders on tart. With time it should soften."
Robert Weil 2000 Tokaji,Robert Weil,Tokaji,,Mars,,US,50,$118.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Basel Cellars 2010 Estate Inspired Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Basel Cellars,Red Blend,Estate Inspired,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,83,$40.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas of Band Aid nearly overwhelm this wine's notes of dried cherry. Flavors are lighter in style, backed by firm tannins."
Siduri 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Siduri,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$32.0,,"This wine combines ripe raspberry and cherry flavors with sweet, smoky oak tones. A wine to drink now, it shows classic Russian River acidity, and it bears a minerally, salty profile that lends structural elegance."
Wetzel Estate 2012 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Wetzel Estate,Pinot Noir,Premier Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,84,$85.0,Paul Gregutt,"High-toned aromatics complement aggressive, unintegrated flavors of raw wood. It's lumber, not toast, that you taste, along with bitter tannins and little evidence of ripe fruit."
Panther Creek 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Panther Creek,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$36.0,Michael Schachner,"An ultrapure nose and tons of polish and precision define this tasty reserve-style blend of several vineyards. Pretty much an easy-drinker, with an undercurrent of sweet cherries and vanilla. It hits all chords and fades away smooth. Style and power come in proper proportions. Will age nicely for at least five years."
Left Coast Cellars 2014 Cali's Cuvée Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Left Coast Cellars,Pinot Noir,Cali's Cuvée Estate Grown,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$24.0,Paul Gregutt,"A splendid example of affordable Oregon Pinot, this benefits from a great vintage for forward, fruit-driven wines. It has additional assets: balance, texture and length, all compact in a young wine still in its infancy. The sappy raspberry fruit and overall polish suggest giving it another couple of years of bottle age before opening."
K Squared Cellars 2014 Ketcham Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),K Squared Cellars,Pinot Noir,Ketcham Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$42.0,Virginie Boone,"Light and earthy, this wine glows in spicy citrus, with a rhubarb-and-strawberry tartness and black tea accents. Medium-bodied, it shows an underlying crispness that belies its weight and depth, the oak subtle yet supportive."

John Anthony 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),John Anthony,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$55.0,,"Good, rich Napa Cabernet in this bottle, packed with blackberry, currant, licorice and cedar flavors. The wine shows a firm, full-bodied texture. Best now and through 2010."
Crane Family 2014 Alison's Cuvée Red (Napa Valley),Crane Family,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alison's Cuvée,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$33.0,Virginie Boone,"This red is made from 70% Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.

Rochioli 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Rochioli,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$35.0,,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages."
VML 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),VML,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,84,$25.0,,"Sweet oak dominates, making it taste like buttered toast dipped into wine. The pineapple and orange fruit underneath all that wood is just fine."

Sullivan,"The aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and black cherry are still locked up but provide appeal.

Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 149 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cameron Hughes,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lot 149,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$22.0,,"Give this young Cabernet a good decant before you serve, because it's a big, brooding wine that needs some air to open up. Right out of the bottle, it's tannic and dry, and the blackberry and black currant flavors are buried under a blanket of astringency. But it's quite a good, well-made wine."
McGregor 2011 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),McGregor,Gewürztraminer,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ripe and lush, this off-dry Gewürztraminer shows remarkable balance between its acidity and ripeness.

This has a succulent core of sweet apple-flavored fruit, quite rich and delicious. It dries out a little toward the back, but continues with excellent length and more of that crystal clear fresh red apple flavor. It's got enough textural interest to keep it from feeling one-dimensional."
Glenora 2002 Brut  (Finger Lakes),Glenora,Champagne Blend,Brut,New York,Finger Lakes,US,81,$25.0,,"The nose on this upstate New York sparkler is promising, with toasty aromas reminiscent of Champagne.

Soléna 2005 Guadalupe Pinot Noir,Soléna,Pinot Noir,Guadalupe,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"This popular vineyard, now almost 20 years old, yields a brambly Pinot Noir which might pass for a Sonoma Coast bottling. More elegant, almost steely, than many of the other Soléna vineyard designates, this offers cooler fruit flavors of rhubarb and wild strawberry, along with anise and dried herb."
Novy 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Novy,Sauvignon Blanc,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$19.0,Virginie Boone,"Creamy and nutty, this wine offers ample herbaceous qualities around muted melon and citrus, finishing with ample lift and refreshment."

Iijima,"While zesty on the nose with lime and lemon aromas, this off-dry Riesling is surprisingly ripe and tropical on the palate.

In some ways, this wine recalls the Eyrie releases of decades ago, and may prove to age well, as many of those wines did. For now, it's a hard stemmy wine with a bit of burn."
Guardian 2010 Stillwater Creek Vineyard The Wanted Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Guardian,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Stillwater Creek Vineyard The Wanted,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$37.0,Paul Gregutt,"Sourced from the Stillwater Creek vineyard this wine spent 20 months in 75% new French oak.

August Briggs 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),August Briggs,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$50.0,,"Deep and sweet, but there's also an unusual and appetizing edge offered via cola nut and root beer. Any tartness to the blackberry fruit is offset by vanillin oak. Pleasurable, full-bodied and on the money. It's stylish good stuff with a correct amount of woody character."
Lange 2012 Yamhill-Carlton Assemblage Pinot Noir,Lange,Pinot Noir,Yamhill-Carlton Assemblage,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$70.0,Paul Gregutt,"Carefully distinguished from the other Lange Pinots, this cuvée marries thick cherry fruit to highlights of cola, anise and earth.

The Forager 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),The Forager,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Sourced from a pair of Yamhill-Carlton vineyards, this steely effort opens with herbal beet-root aromatics.

Virage 2010 Rosé (Napa Valley),Virage,Rosé,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$24.0,,"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry? Sort of, with a jammy finish of black raspberries.

St. Clement 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),St. Clement,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,94,$35.0,,"Very smooth and harmonious, from its cherry, cocoa and smoke-tinged aromatics through the similarly endowed palate, where licorice and cedar notes add further complexity. Balanced, not weighty; it closes with very even tannins and a full, even black-cherry finish with toasty notes. Approachable now; will improve over the next three years."
Woodward Canyon 2000 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Woodward Canyon,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$33.0,Paul Gregutt,"There is an unfortunately strong scent of burnt match to this wine, so much so that it can be tasted as well. Oversulfured though it may be, it's a delicious bottle, with ripe, round fruit, made in a big, balanced style and enhanced with generous new oak. Air it out!"
Hess 2015 Allomi Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Hess,Cabernet Sauvignon,Allomi,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$32.0,Virginie Boone,"With small amounts of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot, this likable, broadly appealing wine is well made, generously rich and softly layered in blue fruit, chocolate and integrated American oak."
Williams Selyem 2015 Papera Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Zinfandel,Papera Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$65.0,Virginie Boone,"From the historic vineyard site surrounded by Pinot Noir, this wine makes the case for variety and heritage, coaxing bright acidity and floral aromatics out of the grapes.

Waterbrook 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Waterbrook,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$15.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Lifted by 8% Carménère and Viognier, it's straight down the fairway with notes of blueberry, orange peel, pepper and brambly fruit. Lighter in style, it tapers toward the finish."
Dutton Estate 2006 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),Dutton Estate,Syrah,Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$40.0,,"Big, rich and extracted, this Syrah is a bit heavy and ponderous now. It shows soft flavors of melted blackberry jam, plum liqueur, dark chocolate, grilled meat and smoky oak, liberally dusted with black pepper. Fancy, but could use through 2009 to knit together."
Robert Weil 2006 Soju,Robert Weil,Soju,,New York,,US,84,$264.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Wine by Joe 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Wine by Joe,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$14.0,Paul Gregutt,"The star of the lineup, this nicely-textured wine is a fine Chardonnay alternative. Fleshy pear, light citrus and a burst of Meyer lemon contribute equally. The length is what elevates this above the basic supermarket style."
Hensley 2009 Hillside Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Hensley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hillside,California,Napa Valley,US,84,$49.0,,"There's too much of everything in this Cabernet. The fruit is massively extracted and sweetly jammy. The oak is a heavy plaster of sweet caramel. The result is impressive for sheer size, but unbalanced. Unlikely to improve with age."

Sullivan,"Aromas are all high toned, with notes of raspberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and spice, with the barrel notes up front.

Longship 2015 Quinn Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Longship,Red Blend,Quinn,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$36.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is a unique blend of 61% Tempranillo, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Grenache. Aromas of coffee grounds, toast, spice and dark fruit are up front, with the oak playing a primary role. The palate mixes fruit and barrel, with the fruit concentration seeming a bit light."
Benton-Lane 2010 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Benton-Lane,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"A pretty, inviting nose suggests sweet cherry and cherry blossom.

In the mouth the toasty barrel flavors wrap around the juicy fruits —raspberry, cherry and more—with streaks of butterscotch creeping into the succulent finish. It's pure pleasure."
Saffron Fields Vineyard 2014 Heritage Clones Pinot Noir,Saffron Fields Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Heritage Clones,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"This wine breaks on the palate like a slider crossing the corner of the plate, just out of reach. A forward, fruit-driven entry drops into a tart midpalate, with plum and berry fruit. It fades away into a finish with strong acids, light chocolate and a hint of bitterness in the tannins."
Mendacious Dingo 2012 Champagknee,Mendacious Dingo,Champagknee,,California,N A,US,6,$309.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Its full-bodied concentration is supported by generous oak. Despite all that power, the tannins remain demure and relatively well behaved."
I'M 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),I'M,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker. Pale and elegantly styled, it shows refined winemaking skills and a European sensibility. Pungently herbal, this supple wine brings young fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry, but shows ageworthy depth and persistence. It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention."
Coeur de Terre 2009 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Coeur de Terre,Riesling,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$19.0,Paul Gregutt,"Made half in stainless steel and half in neutral oak, this comes from 34-year-old vines. It's quite dry, with interesting nuances of sweet grass, clover and green apple. The acids are borderline sour; try this with a bit of prosciutto and a salty cheese."
Willamette Valley Vineyards 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is a real palate-pleaser.

The midpalate is medium bodied and holds together through the finish."
Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Chateau Lafayette Reneau,Chardonnay,Barrel Fermented,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$17.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Chardonnay lovers with a penchant towards rich, buttery wines spiced with cinnamon and vanilla will appreciate this unabashedly oaky yet neatly balanced wine.

Sullivan,"A blend of Grenache (50%) and Cinsault (20%) along with equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah, this wine draws you into the glass with notes of smoked meat, bark, raspberry, blue fruit and peppery spices.

Iijima,"This is a gorgeously perfumed Riesling, chock-full of white flowers and ripe, juicy stonefruit, but not at all cloying.

Frank Family 2009 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Frank Family,Zinfandel,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$37.0,,"A very zinny Zin, packed with the variety's briary blackberry, anise, dark chocolate, bacon and crushed black-pepper flavors. It's the winery's best Zinfandel since the 2006 vintage."

The finish has ample toast, and rolls along through a smooth and satisfying conclusion."
Inspire Moore 2014 Timothy Moore Rice Canandaigua Riesling (Finger Lakes),Inspire Moore,Riesling,Timothy Moore Rice Canandaigua,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$25.0,Anna Lee C.

This is the more expensive of the two, and a fine, fat, forward bottling in this warm vintage. It's three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with lovely fruit that's compact upon opening, fleshing out with air time. Clean, dense and focused, it is bright with berry and cassis flavors, plus subtle barrel notes."

Shows massive blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis and oak flavors packed into profoundly beautiful tannins. The fruit is so sweet that it's surprising how dry the finish is. The winemaker, Ted Henry, also is at the helm of Jarvis. This young Cabernet should develop over the next dozen years, at least, in a good cellar."

Napa Station 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Napa Station,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$20.0,,"Shows classic Napa varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sweet overlay of smoky cedar wood, and the wine is soft and dry. It's not the most complex Cabernet, but the price is fair for the quality."
Andrew Rich 2014 Croft Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley),Andrew Rich,Sauvignon Blanc,Croft Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"This delicious wine makes you wish that a lot more Sauv Blanc was coming out of the Willamette Valley. It's sharp, spicy and bright. The grapefruit and pineapple flavors carry well-defined accents of herb and pine needle. The pinpoint acidity adds further focus."
Glenora 2015 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Glenora,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Pristine fruity touches of fresh apple, pear and lemon shine in this unoaked Chardonnay. Full bodied and round, it's an easy approachable wine with soft sunny acidity. The finish lingers on a bright lemon-candy note."
Merriman 2012 Merriman Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir,Merriman,Pinot Noir,Merriman Vineyard Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"From vines planted in 1999, this nicely oaked effort shows full ripeness without sacrificing details of forest and mushroom. Cherry cola, iron ore and a palate-pleasing dose of barrel toast all contribute to the lengthy finish."
Peju NV Tess Red (Napa Valley),Peju,Red Blend,Tess,California,Napa Valley,US,83,$20.0,,"Pale in color, with a soft, silky body and candied strawberry and vanilla flavors, this blend straddles the line between a red wine and a rosé. You can treat it either way, at room temperature or chilled."
Spindrift Cellars 2013 OSU Woodhall III Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Spindrift Cellars,Pinot Noir,OSU Woodhall III,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$26.0,Paul Gregutt,"Tart cran-apple fruit—some of it from 35-year-old vines—is at the heart of this vineyard-designated cuvée. It has a woody/earthy undertone, tart acids and some stiffening tannins."
Balletto 2014 Winery Block Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Balletto,Pinot Noir,Winery Block Estate Grown,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$42.0,Virginie Boone,"Winery Block is four acres situated around the producer's winemaking facility, a small band of sandy soil. The resulting wine is tart in cherry and pomegranate, with tight acidity and plenty of freshness on the palate. Highlights of citrus and cola spice interweave effortlessly within."
Lucas Vineyards 2013 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Lucas Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Plump, juicy blackberry and cassis are accented by granite and woodsy pine notes in this deeply fruity yet nuanced Cabernet Franc. Supple in mouth feel and tinged with the faintest whisper of tannin, it's an accessible yet elegant wine."
Flora Springs 2011 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Flora Springs,Chardonnay,Barrel Fermented,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$35.0,,"This wine shows the hand of the winemaker in the buttered toast, vanilla, crème brulée, honey and creamy lees that dominate the palate. The underlying fruit is a little thin, suggesting tangerines and papayas. The price-quality ratio is fair."
Roco 2013 Marsh Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir,Roco,Pinot Noir,Marsh Estate Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$50.0,Paul Gregutt,"Aromatically spicy, with a blast of citrus, this follows through with tart cranberry fruit. It's accented with pine needles and more of that tangy citrusy acidity."
William Hill Estate 2010 Bench Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),William Hill Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bench Blend,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$45.0,,"Massive chocolate, black cherry and cassis flavors mark this Cab, not to mention a liberal quantity of sweet, toasty oak. Although it's dry, it tastes as sweet as a dessert pastry. Not an ager, it should be opened by 2016."
Napa Cellars 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),Napa Cellars,Merlot,,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$19.0,Virginie Boone,"Chocolate and raspberry join forces in this jammy, soft and round wine that's sizable yet approachable. This is a good go-to for midweek meals and parties, with a medium body and respectable finish that will pair with a wide range of foods."
Lynmar 2011 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Chardonnay,Susanna's Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$55.0,,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much."
Lauren Ashton Cellars 2013 Cuvée Arlette Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Lauren Ashton Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cuvée Arlette,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$55.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Principally Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon along with smidges of Malbec and Petit Verdot, this wine offers subdued aromas of dark coffee, herb, blackberry and graphite. The coffee and cherry flavors are lighter in style, tapering slightly toward the finish."
VinRoc 2012 RTW Red (Napa Valley),VinRoc,Cabernet Blend,RTW,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$49.0,Virginie Boone,"Blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Syrah, RTW is somewhat classical in its black olive and dried herb, yet also rich and concentrated, with tannic bite and a taste of clove. It finishes like vanilla cola."
Fog Crest 2013 Laguna West Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Fog Crest,Pinot Noir,Laguna West,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$39.0,Virginie Boone,"Pungent earth is met by dark handfuls of baking spice, dried cherry and chocolate in this rich, velvety and full-bodied wine that's smooth and rounded on the palate."
Peter Franus 2005 Red (Napa Valley),Peter Franus,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$60.0,,"Delicious and complex. Shows a superb tannic structure, soft and complicated and refined, housing dry but rich flavors of black currants, cherries, chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper. Elegant and distinguished, and should develop through 2011, at least."
Ledson 1999 Old Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Ledson,Zinfandel,Old Vines,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$36.0,,"From 50-year old vines, a big, jammy wine stuffed with all sorts of berry and tree-fruit flavors. It's Lifesaver candy, a burst of spicy fruit, but thankfully bone dry, balanced, crisp and in its own way authoritative. Soft tannins make it immediately drinkable, and probably not an ager."
Airlie 2013 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Airlie,Riesling,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$16.0,Paul Gregutt,"This low-alcohol, off-dry wine offers tart citrus and apple fruit. Light cinnamon accents and significant acidity somewhat offset the 22g/L of residual sugar."
Montinore 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Montinore,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is labeled reserve, but it's a tart austere wine with little charm. The diluted raspberry fruit carries a metallic note through the finish. Note that the front label correctly says it's a 2014, while the side (back) label mistakenly reads 2013."
Anew 2016 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),Anew,Rosé,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$11.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Pale pink in color, the aromas offer notes of strawberry, bubblegum and apple. Lightly spritzy, it brings forward somewhat-weighty-feeling fruit flavors. Despite the spritz, it seems a bit ponderous."
Lucie 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lucie,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$60.0,,"Ripely delicious and jammy with raspberries, red cherries, and sweet-buttered-toast notes, this Pinot is great for drinking now with steak or lamb chops. With a crisp edge of acidity, it's as elegant and tasty as Russian River Pinot gets."
Firesteed 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Firesteed,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$17.0,Paul Gregutt,Firesteed's value-oriented Pinot is a solid and reliable wine that varies little from vintage to vintage. Flavors of rhubarb and strawberry are set in place with a touch of vanilla wafer. Don't cellar this. It's ready to go.
King Estate 2011 Old School Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),King Estate,Pinot Noir,Old School Vineyards,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$55.0,Paul Gregutt,"Classy and focused, this elegant effort features sharp citrus and raspberry flavors, in a tight, vertical, fruit-driven style. Given its depth and tangy acidity, it seems a good candidate for some additional bottle age, though not long term cellaring."
Château Bianca 2012 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Château Bianca,Riesling,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"Sugary and thin, this has a light mix of citrus flavors—lemon and lime—and a hint of pineapple. It's a pleasant wine, but not up to previous efforts from Chateau Bianca."
Miro 2007 80 Year Old Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Miro,Zinfandel,80 Year Old Vines,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$25.0,,"This is a ripe, lusty Zinfandel, with many special qualities to recommend it. It's dry and rich in smooth tannins, and offers a flood of wild forest berry, sweet new leather, red currant, mocha and exotic Asian spice flavors. Delicious, and will hold for up to six years."
Robert Weil 2004 Riesling,Robert Weil,Riesling,,Fhloston Paradise,NA,US,130,$215.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Amalie Robert 2009 Her Silhouette Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Amalie Robert,Chardonnay,Her Silhouette,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling."
Falcor 2010 Le Bijou Red (Napa Valley),Falcor,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Le Bijou,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$55.0,Virginie Boone,"Aged in bottle for a bit, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and other Bordeaux red grapes is integrated and approachable, persistent in the requisite cassis, cinnamon and clove."
Heron Hill 2005 Ingle Vineyard Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Heron Hill,Chardonnay,Ingle Vineyard Unoaked,New York,Finger Lakes,US,83,$20.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"A nose of clean citrus and spice leads on this simple but likeable Chardonnay. On the palate, it offers more of the fresh flavors and the finish is crisp. A nice wine with seafood and salad, and a good choice for fans of lively whites."
WillaKenzie Estate 2005 Pierre Léon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),WillaKenzie Estate,Pinot Noir,Pierre Léon,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$36.0,Paul Gregutt,"Pierre Léon is a selection of different clones from the winery estate. Maybe it's the vintage, but the wine seems dilute. The flavors of tart wild berry, earth and herb have a thin, edgy character; and the tannins seem greener than what would be optimal."
Rex Hill 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Rex Hill,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$58.0,Paul Gregutt,"Supple, almost silky in the mouth, this slips into lush flavors of mocha truffle, with a core of raspberry fruit. It remains a bit tight through the finish, with light streaks of coffee and fresh herb. Delicious already, it seems destined to improve further with a bit more bottle age. Drink now through 2025."
Buehler 2011 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Buehler,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$36.0,,"A flashy Cabernet, it's the kind that makes red wine lovers sit up and say, “This is really good.” That's because the blackberries, cherries and currants, not to mention new French oak, are so lush. On the other hand, the enjoyment is all upfront, and the wine's aging potential is limited."
J. Lohr 2001 Carol's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),J. Lohr,Sauvignon Blanc,Carol's Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,84,$18.0,,"A faint perfume of pear can be caught on the otherwise dull nose. The flavors run toward candied pear, honeydew and peach. There's some spiciness to the finish, but also a watery quality that doesn't do much for the wine. In the end, it doesn't hit the varietal mark squarely."
Mellisoni 2011 M Series Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Mellisoni,Cabernet Sauvignon,M Series Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$107.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine seems quite evolved for its age, with aromas of leather and dried cranberry. It's light bodied with gritty tannins."
Wagner 2016 Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Wagner,Chardonnay,Unoaked,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$12.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Saline and sea breeze lend refreshing, nautical appeal to this elegant unoaked Chardonnay. It's plush and plump in mouthfeel but anchored by bracing lemon, tangerine and grapefruit flavors. Drink now through 2020."
Marshall Davis 2012 Beacon Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir,Marshall Davis,Pinot Noir,Beacon Hill Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$36.0,Paul Gregutt,"This sure-fire crowd pleaser opens with the steely authority of the AVA's Pinots, showing a streak of earth and bark. Then it fills in, with ripe purple fruit swathed in generous layers of coffee grounds and toasty oak. It finishes long and smoky, with plenty of power."
V. Sattui 2012 Reserve Stock Merlot (Napa Valley),V. Sattui,Merlot,Reserve Stock,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"Voluptuously full-bodied and smoky, this 100% varietal wine imparts characteristics of cedar, herb and cigar on its grippy and generous palate. This is a reserve-level wine that delivers on that promise, it finishes awash in fists of black pepper."
Lucie 2014 Bacigalupi Vinyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lucie,Pinot Noir,Bacigalupi Vinyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"Soft, juicy acidity and texture buoy this wine in wonderful ways, providing a lithe foundation to punches of sassafras and truffled earth. Sourced from the famous vineyard on Westside Road in the northern reaches of the appellation, it shows off a flair of pine along with dark cherry."
Y Rousseau 2016 Old Vine Colombard (Russian River Valley),Y Rousseau,Colombard,Old Vine,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$20.0,Virginie Boone,"Waxy pear flavors ride a lush texture of supportive acidity in this rare white from dry-farmed vines planted more than four decades ago. Food-friendly and light on its feet, it's the perfect picnic wine, ready for charcuterie and cheese."
Standing Stone 2015 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fresh red apples waft from nose to palate on this semidry Riesling. It's vivaciously tart but concentrated in fresh lemon, lime and tangerine flavors. The finish is moderately long but delightfully honeyed."
Spindrift Cellars 2014 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),Spindrift Cellars,Pinot Blanc,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"Soft, ripe and round, this has a slightly liquorous bite to the aromatics. Pear and nectarine fruit is accented with a dash of cinnamon. The wine was 20% barrel fermented."
Pali 2011 Windsor Oaks Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pali,Pinot Noir,Windsor Oaks Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$56.0,,"This is a big, ripe, oaky Pinot Noir. Considering how cold the vintage was, it was quite an achievement to produce such powerful raspberry, cherry and plum fruit flavors. The wine is dry, elegantly tailored and vibrant in acidity, and should peak by 2017."
Vista Hills 2011 Treehouse Estate Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Vista Hills,Pinot Gris,Treehouse Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"An elegant wine with low alcohol yet clean, crisp, persistent flavors, this captures both melon and pear fruit, with peach blossom highlights. Call it a Euro style; it's fresh and subtle."
Keuka Spring 2012 Humphreys Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),Keuka Spring,Riesling,Humphreys Vineyard,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$22.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A bit smoky and savory in style, this slightly off-dry wine balances earthy mineral tones with flavors of pressed pear and apple. Sprightly acidity gives it a refreshing, easy-drinking quality."
Feather 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Feather,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,94,$55.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is Long Shadows's 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a sharp-edged wine with a brilliant mix of berry, cherry and black fruits, sparked by juicy acids. There's spice and chocolate highlights as well, with a purity and focus that suggests cellaring to add more complexity over the course of a decade or longer."
Portalupi 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Portalupi,Zinfandel,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$34.0,Virginie Boone,"A curious streak of sarsaparilla marks this wine aromatically, followed by sparse, soft layers of black fruit and hidden black pepper."
Camaraderie 2008 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Camaraderie,Merlot,Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$38.0,Paul Gregutt,"This reserve spends 30 months in barrel. It has lovely aromatics, with subtle suggestions of tobacco and clove woven through the base of ripe black cherry and cassis. The tannins are polished, and the finish lends a thread of iron."
Merry Edwards 2013 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,Pinot Noir,Georganne,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"Rustic earth and the aromatic sparks of a rose garden open this wine, named by combining the middle names of the producer and her husband. Tight, youthful tannins hover around chocolate, strawberry and blackberry notes, resulting in a velvety texture on the expansive palate. It finishes quietly and confidently, eager to develop further in bottle; enjoy through 2023."
Ponzi 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"Complex aromas have become a Luisa Ponzi hallmark; this one a potpourri of violets, cherry tobacco, clove and cedar, leading into a light, tart palate bursting with wild strawberries. The alcohol rests at 13.5%, but the wine is fully ripe, just not over the top. Graceful, perfectly executed winemaking, in a difficult vintage."
Kenefick Ranch 2008 Chris's Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Kenefick Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chris's Cuvée,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$60.0,,"A bit high in alcohol, this has blackberry and mocha flavors that are overripe, veering into sweet-prune territory. Drink now."
Maryhill 2009 Proprietor's Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Syrah,Proprietor's Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Forward and pleasant, with a balanced attack of berry and peppery herb, this saw 20 months in one-fifth new French oak. The resulting toasty, lightly-chocolaty finish is pleasing, though it tends to override the subtle fruit. Drink soon."
Vercingetorix VX 2014 Caroline's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Vercingetorix VX,Pinot Noir,Caroline's Cuvée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Past vintages of this cuvée have been delightful, but this one hits a speed bump. Diluted fruit flavors conjure up memories of cherry Kool-Aid, with a spare hint of chocolate. The wine has no depth, and not much flavor."
Joleté 2014 Cuvée Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Joleté,Pinot Noir,Cuvée Select,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$29.0,Paul Gregutt,"Good and spicy, this well-structured effort shows some lightly ripened flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and hard cherry candy. A streak of jalapeño pepper runs alongside, delivering impressive definition and length for the price."
Ryan Patrick 2013 Redhead Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Ryan Patrick,Red Blend,Redhead,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$10.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This blend of Merlot, Syrah, Petit Sirah and Primitivo is aromatic and fruit-filled, with notes of confection, blueberry pie, plum, licorice and red fruit. The flavors are sweet, primary and direct with a smooth feel."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Cold Creek Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,Riesling,Cold Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,92,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"Production has zoomed to almost 11,000 cases, but the quality remains. Deep, delicious flavors of melon, grapefruit and kiwi anchor the wine. The sensation of wet rocks and bracing minerality runs alongside the lip-smacking fruit. Perfectly ripe, dense and wonderfully sappy, this is a real gem."
Knapp 2014 Barrel Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Knapp,Chardonnay,Barrel Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$12.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While aged eight months in oak, this elegantly integrated Chardonnay reveals only the faintest whispers of toast and spice. Thirst quenching and quaffable, the palate highlights crisp peach and apricot against a taut backbone of lemon-line acidity. Enjoy now for it's fresh, youthful flair."
Novelty Hill 2012 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),Novelty Hill,Viognier,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$23.0,Paul Gregutt,"A flood of delicious, sweet/sour floral and citrus flavors sweeps across the palate, a lush compound of satsuma orange and highlights of honeysuckle, Meyer lemon and apricot. It's a tart and vivid wine, with lovely concentration and no rough edges."
Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2012 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Thirsty Owl Wine Company,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This delicate wine shimmers with minerality from start to finish. Steely and dry in style, it's brisk with lemon and lime flavors that linger on the finish. It's a bit austere, but notable for the honed, linear feel."
Beringer 2004 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),Beringer,Merlot,Bancroft Ranch Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,85,$75.0,,"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine."
Pamplin 2013 JRG Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Pamplin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,JRG,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,92,$30.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up three-quarters of this blend with the balance Merlot (22%) and Malbec. Coming from a who's who of vineyards that includes Klipsun, Canoe Ridge, Seven Hills, and Alder Ridge, it displays aromas of toasty spices, graphite, fresh herb and black currant. The dark-fruit flavors are polished to a fine sheen, showing hang time on the finish. It impresses."
Treleaven 2014 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Treleaven,Riesling,Semi-Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Zippy white grapefruit and lemon juxtapose more savory tones of crushed mineral, pressed apple and pear in this off-dry Riesling. The palate is sprightly and bright with a clean, moderately persistent finish. Drink now through 2019."
Williams Selyem 2007 Peay Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Peay Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,95,$54.0,,"Pretty tannic, with a hard edge, although it's very fruity and rich, and should soften and mellow with time in the cellar. Thoroughly dry, it shows complex flavors of wild raspberries, cherry compote, cola and spices, compounded with smoky, sweet oak. Give it until 2011 to begin to come around."
Glenora 2008 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Glenora,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$16.0,,"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now."
Hawkins Cellars 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Hawkins Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,83,$20.0,Paul Gregutt,"It's difficult to see how this wine can register alcohol almost 15%. Flavors are thin, green and tannic, with hardly a hint of fruit."
Dutton-Goldfield 2012 Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Dutton-Goldfield,Pinot Noir,Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,94,$72.0,Virginie Boone,"From a coastal vineyard in the southwest corner of the Russian River Valley, this is earthy and brambly on the nose, inviting in its sense of wild abandon. Concentrated yet vibrant in acidity, the flavors lean toward cranberry and tart cherry, completely enveloped in intriguing cardamom spice. Elegant and balanced."
Aberrant Cellars 2014 Gran Moraine Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Aberrant Cellars,Pinot Noir,Gran Moraine Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,95,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage. Blackberry and black cherry fruit, adorned with a sprinkling of Sumatra coffee beans, rocks on with polished tannins. The pleasing roasted character is just right to power it through a clean, sexy finish. Drink now and on through 2026."
Heron Hill 2009 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),Heron Hill,Riesling,Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Bone dry, with bristling notes of wet stone, slate and petrol, this boasts striking minerality, with undertones of white blossoms, limes and sugar cookie that linger delicately on the finish. Brisk with acidity, it would pair fabulously with goat cheese or fatty salmon."
Trinity Vineyards 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Trinity Vineyards,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$19.0,Paul Gregutt,"Massively fruity, this is an apple/pear bonanza, fleshy and almost lasciviously delicious. The huge fruit flavors convey an impression of sweetness, though this is not identified as off dry. It has tremendous density and length."
Waterbrook 2016 Mélange Founder's White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Waterbrook,White Blend,Mélange Founder's,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Riesling and Gewürztraminer make up over half of this wine, giving it an aromatic punch. Vibrant ripe peach, flower and pear scents lead to an off-dry palate with fleshy fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal, though the concentration, especially through the midpalate, seems light."
Bergevin Lane 2011 She-Devil Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Bergevin Lane,Syrah,She-Devil,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$24.0,Paul Gregutt,"This excellent Syrah captures much of the depth and complexity of higher priced bottles. Boysenberry fruit provides a concentrated core of flavor and rings of licorice, earth, coffee, smoke and vanilla circle through the lingering finish. Tannins are a bit on the crunchy side."
Patel 2011 Red (Napa Valley),Patel,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,California,Napa Valley,US,83,$60.0,Virginie Boone,"Weedy and herbal, this Merlot-based blend is thick and rich in black cherry and medium oak, with an abbreviated finish."
SKN 2007 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),SKN,Chardonnay,,California,Napa Valley,US,84,$15.0,,"Chardonnay fans will like the pineapple and pear flavors, with their creamy, spicy edge of vanilla and pepper spice. It's a direct, dry wine at a pretty good price."
Keuka Spring 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Keuka Spring,Cabernet Franc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$19.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Notes of ripe, fleshy red fruit on the nose and palate are grazed with hints of smoked meat, nuts and dried sage—an appetizing mélange of sweet and savory elements. While it's full bodied, the zesty acidity makes for a refreshing yet satisfying sip."
WillaKenzie Estate 2007 Gamay Noir (Willamette Valley),WillaKenzie Estate,Gamay Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"A delightful bottle, this fruit-packed Gamay has more stuffing and sweetness than most of the Oregon Pinots from 2007. Plums, cherries and black currants ramble through the mouth, running into some fairly stiff, chewy tannins. This is a sturdy, immediately drinkable, thoroughly enjoyable quaffer."
Apsara 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Apsara,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$70.0,Virginie Boone,"Robust, pillowy tannins provide a density and grip that lasts through the finish of this 100% varietal wine. Blackberry, black currant and vanilla are the highlights, finding balance and powerful concentration on the palate."
Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Lemberger (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Lemberger,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$22.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Gorgeously purple in hue, this sharp, peppery Lemberger offers loads of concentrated blackberry and plum flavors. It's lavishly textured yet sharply balanced, marked by crisp acidity and fine tannins. Savory complexities of smoked meat and tobacco linger through a long, velvety finish."
Black Cat 2010 Family Cuvée Red (Napa Valley),Black Cat,Red Blend,Family Cuvée,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$48.0,,"This is a 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from Coombsville. It's dense with tannins, but they're very finely woven, and the wine has a gentle grace. The flavors of blackberries are pristine and ripe, and accompanied by a new oak smokiness. Good as it is now, it will develop bottle complexity after 2016."
Heart & Hands 2011 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Heart & Hands,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fresh wildflower and pear aromas, with just a hint of yeastiness, introduce a bold, textured palate that's full of flower and stone fruit flavors. Striking acidity drives the long, penetrating finish."
Boedecker Cellars 2005 Anderson Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Boedecker Cellars,Pinot Noir,Anderson Family Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is a limited (two barrels) bottling from a Dundee Hills vineyard. Tight red currant fruit is streaked with licorice and baking chocolate. There's plenty of acid, not entirely integrated into the fruit, and a hint of caramel in the finish. Good components, though not yet a complete and seamless wine."
Gary Farrell 2007 Starr Ridge Vineyard - Dijon Clones Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Gary Farrell,Pinot Noir,Starr Ridge Vineyard - Dijon Clones,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$50.0,,"A big, young Pinot Noir that shows brilliant stuffing and complexity, but it's rather heavy and tannic now, and not a wine to open before, say, 2011 at the very least. In its youth it displays rich, jammy flavors of red cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood, and is very dry. Should evolve slowly through 2015 or beyond."
Lange 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Lange,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is well-made in a classic Oregon mold, which is to say, putting plenty of herbal highlights into the mix. There are light red fruits in abundance as well, and the flavors meld well through a medium-long finish."
Château Frank NV Célèbre Crémant Riesling (Finger Lakes),Château Frank,Riesling,Célèbre Crémant,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$21.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Gorgeous floral tones abound throughout this fruity, fresh, sparkling Riesling. It's a bit chewy and mouth-filling in foam, but pristine peach and apple flavors and spine-tingling acidity are enthralling."
Shaw 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Shaw,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Benefits of bottle aging show well in this late release by Shaw. Clean and minerally with a shower of freshly squeezed lemon and honeysuckle on the nose, this almost dry Riesling is lush with honey and white peaches on the palate. There's a sleek backbone of steel and slate that adds elegance to a lingering white tea finish."
Krupp Brothers 2011 Synchrony Stagecoach Vineyard Red (Napa Valley),Krupp Brothers,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Synchrony Stagecoach Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$100.0,Virginie Boone,"Based on 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, with all four major red Bordeaux varieties represented, this expansive wine is big, dense and dusty in tannins and oak, but offers a soft side, too. Cherry, strawberry and a lift of citrus peel ease the power and intensity, before a chewy, dark chocolate finish. Cellar through 2021."
Jamieson Ranch 2011 Double Lariat Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Jamieson Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,Double Lariat,California,Napa Valley,US,89,$45.0,,"A very nice wine, showcasing the Napa style of lush, plush opulence. It's softly tannic, with ripe blackberry, raspberry, mocha and cedar flavors. Not an ager—drink by 2015."
Gia Domella 2007 Reserve Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Gia Domella,Zinfandel,Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,81,$65.0,,"Feels hot and Porty in the mouth, although it's very dry, with bitter raisinskin and shriveled cherry flavors. The alcohol approaches 16%."
Oakville Ranch 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Oakville Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$60.0,,"Very fruit-driven, this dry Cab has jammy cherry, blackberry and currant flavors, with a rich edge of cedar and cocoa. It's a bit immature now and should develop bottle complexities over the next 6–8 years."
Eric Ross 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Marsanne-Roussanne (Russian River Valley),Eric Ross,Marsanne-Roussanne,Saralee's Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$28.0,,"A beautiful wine, dry, complex and crisp, and easily one of the best white Rhône-style bottlings of the vintage. It shows brilliantly clean acidity that provides a brisk mouthfeel to the apricot, pineapple and pear flavors that rest on a firm ground of minerals. Great as a richer, more exotic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc."
Wine Spots 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),Wine Spots,Merlot,,California,Napa Valley,US,85,$25.0,Virginie Boone,"There's not much to this light-bodied Merlot, its soft dark cherry, vanilla and plum flavors muted and hard to make out. From a San Francisco-based vintner making wines from around the world, including Bordeaux and South Australia, it sources Merlot from both Rutherford and Oakville."
Spindrift Cellars 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Spindrift Cellars,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"Fresh and clean, with very tart and herbal flavors, and lighter suggestions of pear and lime fruit. The zippy acidity defines the wine; it's clean and bracing."
V. Sattui 2008 Crow Ridge Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),V. Sattui,Zinfandel,Crow Ridge,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$35.0,,"A big, lusty, rich Zinfandel, packing wildly complex flavors of summer-ripe raspberries and cherries, anise, crushed pepper, dusty spices, sweet vanilla and smoky sandalwood. One of V. Sattui's best Zins of the vintage."
Goose Ridge 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Goose Ridge,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,This excellent estate-grown Merlot is a standout in the current Goose Ridge lineup. A scent of violet introduces a dark and potent wine. Plum and black cherry are enhanced by streaks of rock and tar. The tannins are supple and substantial.
Jax 2008 Y3 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Jax,Sauvignon Blanc,Y3,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$17.0,,"A pretty, polished Sauvignon Blanc for drinking as a cocktail sipper with all kinds of zesty appetizers. It's dryish and crisp in acidity, with rich flavors of pineapples, lemons, kiwi fruit, limes and vanilla."
Frei Brothers 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Frei Brothers,Chardonnay,Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$20.0,,"Made in an immediately appealing, oaky way, this Chard has appealing peach, pear, green apple and honey flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie. Easy to find, with more than a million bottles in circulation."
Siduri 2014 Pratt Vineyard Sexton Road Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Siduri,Pinot Noir,Pratt Vineyard Sexton Road,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$52.0,Virginie Boone,"Lush and vibrantly balanced, this wine is marked by juicy layers of blueberry, huckleberry and spicy cola and clove. Velvety-smooth on the palate, it's a satisfying, medium-bodied effort that effectively shows the beauty of the site and the vintage."
Wagner 2006 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Wagner,Riesling,Semi Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$13.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"This Riesling has aromas that almost mimic a Chardonnay: toasty cream, vanilla, spice. On the palate, those more complex flavors continue, but are buoyed by some acidity and an intriguing touch of sweet flowers. Overall, a tasty sip."
Russian River Vineyards 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Russian River Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Estate Grown,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$55.0,,"Rich flavors of cherries, persimmons, cola, anise and oak flood the mouth with immediate deliciousness. Bright Russian River acidity provides fortunate balance. It's delicious now, but young; this has the balance to develop nicely, so give it 6–7 years."
Abiqua Wind 2014 Collier's Early Muscat (Willamette Valley),Abiqua Wind,Muscat,Collier's Early,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,84,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"This wine seems disjointed from the initial aromas through the finish. Its perfume, lemon polish and other mismatched components don't indicate any improvement ahead."
Kiona 1998 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Kiona,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$20.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is still the current release. A very hot vintage in Washington, it leads with a Portlike nose of raisins and prunes; follows with soft, ripe and roasted flavors. The tannins are deep and earthy. Drink now. —P.G."
WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Triple Black Slopes Pinot Noir,WillaKenzie Estate,Pinot Noir,Triple Black Slopes,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$75.0,Paul Gregutt,"A slightly bitter tobacco note frames black-cherry fruit. The tannins need more time to smooth out, and that bitter streak is a bit worrisome. But that said, this powerful deep compact wine may explode with flavor if you have the patience to cellar it. Drink after 2020."
Furious George 2020 Sake,Furious George,Sake,,Mars,N A,US,19,$18.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Shalestone 2007 Synergy Red (Finger Lakes),Shalestone,Red Blend,Synergy,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Rich and ripe on the nose with dark black fruit and olives, this is an easygoing blend of Syrah, Cab and Merlot. Medium-bodied in style, it's soft on the palate with plush tannins and flavors of cooked plum compote accented by darker hints of olive and sage."
O'Connor 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),O'Connor,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"A small-production wine from longtime growers, this is light and herbal, integrated in wood and tannin. It's vibrant and fresh on the palate and nose in plum and wild strawberry. High in gentle acidity, it provides a note of black tea and earthy truffle on the finish. Drink now through 2021."
Ryan Patrick 2012 Ryan's Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Ryan Patrick,Riesling,Ryan's,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$10.0,Paul Gregutt,"Here's a perfect go-to, every day Riesling for warm weather. Pretty fruit flavors of peach and apple are laced with orange pekoe tea. Medium-bodied and mouthfilling, it's got excellent length and structure."
Frog's Leap 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Frog's Leap,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$42.0,,"Good Cabernet, dry and complex, showing classic Napa character. The tannin structure is near perfect, while the flavors are ripe and juicy in blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar. Polished now and through 2013."
Fulkerson 2014 Rosé (Finger Lakes),Fulkerson,Rosé,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While a bit shy in both bouquet and concentration, this cherry-kissed rosé is a refreshing summer sip. A blend of Pinot Noir and Dornfelder, it's a touch tart with a brisk, zippy finish."
Casa Larga 2009 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),Casa Larga,Pinot Noir,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,87,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of mushroom and autumn leaf add complexity to this Pinot Noir's dried cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The palate boasts an ample black-cherry flavor and delicate tannins that linger on the finish, melding into a dark chocolate and graphite-tinged note."
Lakewood 2011 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Lakewood,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While quite earthy and smoky on the nose, this off-dry Riesling is pleasantly fruity on the palate showing fresh apple and lemon flavors accented with vibrant lime acidity. The finish is brisk with some astringency."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$13.0,Paul Gregutt,"Co-fermented with Viognier (for the first time at Ste. Michelle), this aims for a brighter, softer style of Syrah. It's plenty soft, pleasantly accessible, and lightly toasty. The smoothness seems to have eliminated some of the brightness, the hills and valleys that make Syrah so distinctive in Washington."
Karma Vineyards 2012 Pink Bubbly Méthode Traditionnelle Sparkling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Karma Vineyards,Sparkling Blend,Pink Bubbly Méthode Traditionnelle,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$40.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Pale pink in color, this wine offers aromas of herb, yeast, and overripe red apple. The apple-skin flavors are dry with tart acidity."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Artist Series Meritage (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,Meritage,Artist Series,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$57.0,Paul Gregutt,"This new Artist Series red is three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, and the rest a mix of Cab Franc and Malbec, mostly from the Cold Creek Vineyard. Blue and black fruits are enhanced with barrel flavors of smoke, tobacco and espresso. Some additional years in bottle should help this wine knit together seamlessly."
Dr. Konstantin Frank 2010 Rkatsiteli (Finger Lakes),Dr. Konstantin Frank,Rkatsiteli,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Green herbs and grass add freshness to the sweet aromas of quince and peach preserves on this interpretation of the Georgian Rkatsiteli grape. Intense fruit flavors persist on the palate, highlighted by lemon-lime acidity and lime-pith astringency."
Williams Selyem 2011 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,Chardonnay,Heintz Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$55.0,,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years."
Quilceda Creek 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Quilceda Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,94,$140.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is 100% varietal coming from Champoux, Palengat and Wallula Gap vineyards. The aromas bring plenty of appeal, with notes of incense, spice box and dark fruit that lead to full exquisitely balanced dark fruit flavors that show polish, poise and a lengthy finish."
Roco 2014 Knudsen Vineyards Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Roco,Chardonnay,Knudsen Vineyards,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,94,$60.0,Paul Gregutt,"Smooth and full bodied, this is packed with robust peach, pear, apple, lime and candied pineapple. There's a streak of vanilla custard from time in new oak, and length-extending minerality. This just keeps on going in the most delightful fashion."
Hawkins Cellars 2009 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Hawkins Cellars,Sangiovese,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Quite light, with tart rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's more than a hint of peppery herb, and a tart, quick finish."
Judd's Hill 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Judd's Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,85,$45.0,,"Direct and fruity, with blackberry and blueberry flavors, wrapped into rugged tannins. Finishes a little sweet. Drink over the next few years."
Alpha Omega 2003 Vinegar,Alpha Omega,Vinegar,,California,NA,US,196,$156.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Aubichon Cellars 2013 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Aubichon Cellars,Pinot Noir,Oregon,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"As with many of Oregon's 2013 Pinots, this is more refined, more austere, more herbal and lower in alcohol than the fruity, forward 2012s. It's a matter of personal preference which is preferable. The fruit here begins in rhubarb and runs to raspberry, with a stop for citrus peel along the way. Spicy highlights of clove and coriander roll into a bright finish."
Lucas Vineyards 2007 Vignoles (Finger Lakes),Lucas Vineyards,Vignoles,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$11.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone."
Bunnell 2008 Lia Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Bunnell,Rhône-style Red Blend,Lia,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$34.0,Paul Gregutt,"Mourvèdre dominates the 2008 Lia, with Grenache, Counoise and Syrah filling in the rest. Fragrant and plummy, it's a mouth-filling Rhône-style blend, with smooth, lightly chocolaty tannins."
Keuka Lake Vineyards 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Keuka Lake Vineyards,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of pine forest lend a pristine alpine feel to this bold dry Riesling. The palate is concentrated, with sun-streaked tones of pineapple and peach balanced by bristling lemon-lime acidity. The finish is moderately long with a lingering honeycomb note."
Ferrari-Carano 2010 Tré Terre Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Ferrari-Carano,Chardonnay,Tré Terre,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$32.0,,"Lots to like in this ripe Chardonnay. It has fruit-forward pineapple, kiwi and apricot flavors, brightened with citrusy acidity, and enriched by sweet, smoky oak. A rich, elegant wine to drink now with lamb, ahi tuna or by itself as an appetizer."
Guardian 2015 Newsprint Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Guardian,Chardonnay,Newsprint,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$18.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas are light, with notes of toast, char, apple, lees and spice. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a lightly creamy feel. It's a straightforward easy drinker where the variety is unmistakable."
L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),L'Ecole No. 41,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$32.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Hailing from 11 different vineyards located across the Columbia Valley, this appealing, 100% varietal wine provides aromas of toasty spices, dried herbs, cocoa and jammy dark fruit. The cranberry, coffee and blackberry flavors are sweet and focused, backed by chewy, lightly dry tannins that need time to soften."
Barnard Griffin 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Barnard Griffin,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,83,$17.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together."
Vino Vargas 2012 RIo Ruso Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Vino Vargas,Pinot Noir,RIo Ruso,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"Light in texture, this wine shows a fair amount of barrel influence aromatically. On the palate, it's similarly challenging to disregard the oak, which frames a mid-weight body marked by sour cherry."
North by Northwest 2014 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),North by Northwest,Red Blend,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,89,$15.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is near equal parts Syrah and Merlot with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of blue fruit, vanilla, cherry and herb lead to full-bodied pit-fruit flavors that bring a sense of deliciousness that is hard to resist."
Wind Rose 2013 Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA)),Wind Rose,Primitivo,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$25.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas of red fruit, herb and spice are followed by tart, full-bodied fruit flavors. A persistent finish caps it off."
Duckhorn 2011 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),Duckhorn,Cabernet Franc,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$70.0,Virginie Boone,"The grapes for this wine hail from esteemed sites, including Three Palms and Cork Tree, and their good farming shows. Cherry and cassis aromas and flavors provide the wine with vibrancy, while well-structured tannins and a juicy core balance each other out. The oak is integrated and the finish long."
Novelty Hill 2013 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Novelty Hill,Sauvignon Blanc,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$20.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Barrel fermented in new and used French oak and aged sur lie for seven months, this appealing wine brings aromas of pear, spice, fig and papaya. The Sémillon blended in (16%) adds to the palate's richness and weight, with the pleasingly long finish contributing to the enjoyment."
Heron Hill 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Heron Hill,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A hint of pine fronds lends a cool, alpine touch to tart white peach and pineapple flavors in this vivacious dry Riesling. Zesty acidity enlivens the midpalate and extends out the finish. Drink now–2017."
Lenné Estate 2014 Estate Pinot Noir,Lenné Estate,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$45.0,Paul Gregutt,"This barrel selection is difficult to spot, because the word “estate” is just very lightly imprinted under the name Lenné. It's clearly a bigger juicier more tannic wine than its excellent sibling, with deep flavors of raspberry fruit, highlights of white pepper, and acids that push the flavors down through the palate."
Zerba Cellars 2006 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Zerba Cellars,Sangiovese,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"Like most Washington Sangiovese, a bit nondescript. You won't mistake it for Chianti, but it doesn't have the ripe strawberry and tobacco punch of the best versions from this state. It's light, herbal, and has gentle tannins with suggestions of cracker and grain."
Van Duzer 2016 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Van Duzer,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is lively and tart, suggesting citrus rind, grapefruit and juniper berries. There's a snap to the acidity and some bitterness in the finishing flavors."
Pacific Rim 2015 Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Pacific Rim,Riesling,Dry,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$11.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas bring notes of jasmine, lime zest and honeysuckle. It drinks dry, with lightly concentrated fruit flavors that lead to a floral finish. It provides enjoyment but the concentration doesn't seem all there."
Bacio Divino 2008 Red (Napa Valley),Bacio Divino,Red Blend,,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$80.0,,"Heavy and sweet, almost sugary in blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, with a smoky, hot finish. A good wine that will appeal to those who like its candied taste."
Davis Bynum 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Davis Bynum,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$25.0,,"A real fruit bomb, with explosive flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and peaches, accented with sweet smoky oak. Malolactic fermentation adds softer flavors of buttered popcorn."
Grgich Hills 2010 Estate Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Grgich Hills,Zinfandel,Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$35.0,,"Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors flood the mouth on this Zin, making it instantly delicious. The superripeness shows on the finish, where chocolate-covered raisin notes show up. With complex, gentle tannins and some heat from alcohol, it's drinking well now."
Greyscale 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Greyscale,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$54.0,Virginie Boone,"Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove."
Mercer Canyons 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Mercer Canyons,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$13.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Pleasing aromas of butter, spice and apple lead to elegant, creamy-feeling flavors. It's a very tasty, very varietally correct wine."
Ca' Momi 2012 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Ca' Momi,Chardonnay,,California,Napa Valley,US,84,$20.0,,"Similar to the winery's previous efforts, this is a soft, sweet and simple Chardonnay. The orange, apricot, vanilla and buttered toast flavors are good, but the wine lacks structure."
Silvan Ridge 2005 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Silvan Ridge,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$22.0,Paul Gregutt,"Forward and fruity, this has California-style fruit and sweet, strawberry candy. The difference is that it fills out the middle with some leafy, herbal flavors, nothing too rough, but enough to add some flavor interest. The finish is fat and buttery, showing the influence of oak aging."
Midsummer Cellars 2009 Cañon Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Midsummer Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cañon Creek Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$44.0,,"Here's a lush, fruity Cabernet, brimming with blackberry, black currant and flashy oak flavors. It straddles that line between a tannic young wine you can drink now after decanting, and one to age. Probably best opened by 2015."
Conti Costanti 2002 IPA,Conti Costanti,IPA,,Mars,N A,US,30,$156.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
JR Wine 2009 The Devious Woman Red (Napa Valley),JR Wine,Red Blend,The Devious Woman,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$34.0,,"Well-made and creatively blended from Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah, this is a big, tannic wine, formidable in sweet blackberry, cherry, licorice and spice flavors. It's not subtle, but it is authentic. Drink now."
Guzzling Goose 2000 Pinot Vert,Guzzling Goose,Pinot Vert,,Oregano,,US,117,$382.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Sandler 2015 Cuvée Ma Belle Heintz Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Sandler,Chardonnay,Cuvée Ma Belle Heintz Ranch,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$40.0,Matt Kettmann,"Coconut oil, buttercream and vanilla custard show on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard. Flavors tighten up on the sip, where a grippy texture shows squeezed lemon and the slightest hint of tropicality."
Hogue 2013 Genesis Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Hogue,Cabernet Sauvignon,Genesis,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$16.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, dried herbs and plum lead to black-currant flavors that display a reserved styling. A light grip of tannins provides the frame."
Songbird 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Songbird,Sauvignon Blanc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$11.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This is a straightforward easy-drinker with aromas of cantaloupe and kiwi leading to off-dry, lightly styled fruit flavors."
Mendacious Dingo 2013 Riesling,Mendacious Dingo,Riesling,,Fhloston Paradise,N A,US,53,$22.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Houdini 2007 Glendale Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Houdini,Cabernet Sauvignon,Glendale Ranch,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$40.0,,"Here's a good, useful Cabernet with some real elegance. It's bone dry and sturdy in tannins, with solid blackberry and currant flavors leading to a long, sweet finish. Drink over the next three years."
Waterbrook 2010 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Waterbrook,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This 100% varietal wine hails from Canyon Vineyard Ranch and Oasis vineyards. It's tart and puckering with notes of cocoa, raspberries and licorice and a firm squeeze of tannins. Barrel notes of vanilla and dill linger on the finish."
Damiani 2015 Bollicini Sparkling (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Sparkling Blend,Bollicini,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Blossomy in perfume, this Prosecco-inspired Finger Lakes sparkling offers fresh fruity citrus and red-apple flavors. It's softer and looser in petillance than wines made with Damiani's traditional method of bottling but striking acidity lends bold upright structure. Drink now."
Stottle 2012 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),Stottle,Tempranillo,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$30.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Toast, coffee, vanilla, dill and other wood spices are far out-front on the aromas. They vie for attention on the palate as well, never seeming to marry with the fruit while still providing enjoyment."
Joseph Jewell 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Joseph Jewell,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$34.0,Virginie Boone,"An opulent nose of spicy cherry and cranberry invites one into the glass, before complementary flavors echo on the palate. Earthy forest floor and a piquant structure of acidity give it intrigue and complexity, before the wine finishes lean."
MacPhail 2010 The Flyer Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),MacPhail,Pinot Noir,The Flyer,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$59.0,,"This Pinot tastes so oaky, it's like chewing on barrel staves. Notes of vanilla, buttered toast and the creamy-sweet flavor of oak sap completely overwhelm what otherwise seems like a good wine. This is a real outlier among MacPhail's other 2010 Pinot Noirs."
Sequoia Grove 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Sequoia Grove,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$40.0,,"This is a dark, big, deeply flavored Cabernet whose tannic structure strongly suggests mid- to long-term aging. Bone dry, it has flashy flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and cedar. Very fine. Best 2010–2015, if not longer in a proper cellar."
Shane Wines 2013 The Charm Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Shane Wines,Pinot Noir,The Charm,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$42.0,Jim Gordon,"Drenched in luxurious, almost sweet fruit flavors, this tempting and delicious wine is full bodied. Ripe in aromas and on the palate, it creates a vivid and warming cherry-pie effect on the senses, and is undeniably tasty."
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,Merlot,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$45.0,,"You might want to age this for a couple years, because it's a little tough in tannins, more so than you might expect from a Napa Merlot. But it's very rich in cherry, red currant, green olive and oak flavors."
Lynmar 2009 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Pinot Noir,Quail Hill Vineyard Summit,California,Russian River Valley,US,96,$70.0,,"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy."
Cardwell Hill 2014 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Cardwell Hill,Pinot Gris,Estate Bottled,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"The impression is that some of the fruit may have teetered on the edge of overripe, as the wine has a grainy, sugary mouthfeel. It's not overtly sweet, just granular, and the pear fruit flavors are lightly honeyed. It's best to drink this by late 2016."
Cinco 2011 Tej,Cinco,Tej,,New York,,US,199,$282.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Iijima,"Scents of white grapefruit and honeydew rind introduce this dry, refreshing Riesling.

Robert Weil 2017 Pinot Vert,Robert Weil,Pinot Vert,,France,N A,US,162,$180.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Benton-Lane 2012 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),Benton-Lane,Pinot Blanc,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$19.0,Paul Gregutt,"Barrel-fermented and aged in 15% new French oak, this is Pinot Blanc done in a Chardonnay style. Buttery and toasty, with light Asian pear and green apple fruit, it's balanced and drinking nicely, best for near-term consumption."
Charles Krug 2011 Yountville Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Charles Krug,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yountville,California,Napa Valley,US,83,$30.0,Virginie Boone,"This wine is a mix of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot that is tight, tannic and a tad green."
Castle Rock 2014 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Castle Rock,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,86,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas of green wood, herb and cherry lead to ripe but chalky feeling fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but a sense of astringency and bitterness proves distracting."
Shaw 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),Shaw,Sauvignon Blanc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"The future of Finger Lakes Sauvingnon Blanc is bright, at least in the hands of Steve Shaw. Fragrant with sweet, ripe gooseberries, apples and a touch of herbs and grass, this is a delicious choice for any occasion. Full bodied and complex, its palate is lush with quince and green plums, highlighted by a refreshing minerality and a lime zest astringency."
WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Terres Basses Pinot Noir,WillaKenzie Estate,Pinot Noir,Terres Basses,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$75.0,Paul Gregutt,"Dark and fruity, this juicy wine is packed with black cherry and highlighted with tobacco and coffee. The tannins are substantial, and hint at clean earth. It's big and full through the middle, but tails off a bit in the finish."
Kirkland Signature 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Kirkland Signature,Merlot,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$9.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is fruity and clean, with plenty of pretty cherry-fruit flavor. A whiff of wood smoke and pipe tobacco carves its way through the fruit and into the finish."
Landmark 2014 Rayhill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Landmark,Pinot Noir,Rayhill Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$65.0,Virginie Boone,"Earthy baked cherry and a strong streak of cardamom make for an impressive entry to this wine, flavors that persist on the palate. Beautifully rich without being ridiculous, it finds balance in complex, layered textures and nuanced characteristics, with a length of rose petals on the finish."
Arcane Cellars 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Arcane Cellars,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$24.0,Paul Gregutt,"It's toasty and lush with the scents and flavors of roasted walnuts and butterscotch; not a bad thing by any means. Under the sweet oak are flavors of berry, tart and fresh as if just-picked. This is a thoroughly delightful bottle and a rare find at this price—a Pinot Noir that can be enjoyed immediately but should cellar well for up to a decade."
Damiani 2015 Little Lotus Flower Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Sauvignon Blanc,Little Lotus Flower,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$22.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,This highly aromatic Sauvignon Blanc dishes out loads of pretty white peach and yellow cherry flavors backed by a bristling streak of acidity. It's a vibrant yet satisfyingly full-bodied wine with a pristine grapefruit finish. Drink now through 2020.
Sanctuary 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Sanctuary,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"From two superb vineyard sites, Charles Heinz and Dutton Ranch, both on the cool edges of the Sonoma Coast and Russian River Valley, this is a thick, concentrated and delicious wine, which manages its richness with grace. Honey, vanilla and baked apple linger on the palate, finishing softly and with a note of nutmeg."
Duckhorn 2012 The Discussion Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),Duckhorn,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The Discussion Estate Grown,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$135.0,Virginie Boone,"A blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a likable wine, rich in red berry, currant and vanilla. Firm, integrated tannins behave on the back of the palate, allowing for a softness amid the robust, full-bodied concentration."
Longboard 2008 Goosechase Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),Longboard,Syrah,Goosechase Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,93,$47.0,,"A tremendous Syrah, so rich and tasty, it makes you wonder why more people don't drink this variety. Shows intense, explosive blackberry, currant, bacon and black pepper flavors, with a savory hint of raisins. New oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dramatic and lush, this single-vineyard Syrah will provide good drinking over the next four years."
Robert Biale 2014 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Robert Biale,Zinfandel,Founding Farmers,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$32.0,Virginie Boone,"This rich, rewarding wine pleases in baked blueberry pie and a taste of raisin cake, its texture underlined in soft, integrated oak and a velvety density. Cinnamon, black pepper and toffee weave within the waves of ripeness."

Sullivan,"This Chardonnay's lees, custard, pear and spice aromas are somewhat inharmonious. It's elegant on the palate, however, showing graceful apple flavors."
Seven Hills 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Seven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Still young, steely and firm, but classy and deep. This has the best attributes of the '05 and '06 Columbia Valley Cabs from Seven Hills—ripe and polished black fruits, firm tannins, a supple finish with a veneer of smoke and licorice. In other words, this is a complete, complex and intriguing Bordeaux blend, with plenty of aging potential."
Oak Knoll 2012 Tuenge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Oak Knoll,Pinot Noir,Tuenge Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,85,$26.0,Paul Gregutt,"This single vineyard selection is softly herbal, with peppery strawberry fruit. The finish leaves an impression of water crackers."
Foundry 2012 Broken Rock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Foundry,Cabernet Sauvignon,Broken Rock Vineyard,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$82.0,Virginie Boone,"Chocolate-covered cherry and plum surround a shock of stark acidity on this wine that has a round and soft palate. On the finish, a touch of astringency flirts with cedar."
L'Ecole No. 41 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),L'Ecole No. 41,Syrah,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is a powerful, sappy, sensuous and fragrantly fruit-driven mix of Syrah from the Seven Hills, Clifton, Bacchus, Candy Mountain, Willard, Pheasant and Stone Tree vineyards—a true Columbia Valley potpourri. It's blended with 7% Grenache from Stone Tree as well, adding floral/violet highlights. It's a well-made Syrah that reflects the particular Washington profile of floral aromas, tart berry fruit and juicy acids. Excellent focus and definition in a style built for acid lovers."
Sineann 2006 Sugarloaf Mountain Merlot (Napa Valley),Sineann,Merlot,Sugarloaf Mountain,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$30.0,,"The winery has an outstanding track record with Oregon varieties. Now that they've moved southward, the results are average. Their first Napa Merlot is rich and well-structured, but kind of sweet and simple in vanilla-flavored cherries, currants and black raspberries, with a chocolate edge. The alcohol level, in the mid-15s, is a problem."
Belhurst 2009 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Belhurst,Riesling,Semi-Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,88,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This aromatic semisweet Riesling is a bouquet of jasmine blossoms and luscious pears laced with lime and musk.

Six Mile Creek 2012 Seyval Blanc (Finger Lakes),Six Mile Creek,Seyval Blanc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,83,$14.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Toast and dried herb notes lend an oaky tone to pressed apple and pear flavors on this Seyval Blanc. It's dry and full bodied in style, with a bright, lemon-focused midpalate that finishes a bit sour and woody."
Freja 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Freja,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,86,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"This shows solid secondary fruity flavors of strawberry compôte and a thin slice of cherry pie. It offers a whiff of leather and some drying tannins, with a finish of black tea. Drink this up soon."
Ponzi 2011 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Pinot Blanc,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$17.0,Paul Gregutt,"This estate-grown, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc is succulent, tart and tangy, with lightly spicy citrus, kiwi and starfruit flavors. The lingering finish, lightly flecked with dried herbs, shows amazing grip and texture, with a mineral ridge across the mid palate. Great elegance and length."
Jones of Washington 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Jones of Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"Honeysuckle scents and ripe, fresh fruit flavors run from grapefruit on into tropical. This was fermented in Hungarian puncheons, picking up just a hint of toast along the way. Clean and quite delicious."
Andretti 2008 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley),Andretti,Pinot Grigio,,California,Napa Valley,US,84,$29.0,,"Slightly sweet and simple, with the tart flavor of sour pineapple candy. Crisp acidity earns it an extra point."
Casa Larga 2009 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Casa Larga,Gewürztraminer,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$13.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Grassy, herbaceous tones are a tad pungent, but they add freshness to this lusciously textured, easy-drinking Gewürz. It's off-dry, with loads of fleshy yellow peach, pineapple and melon flavors, with delicate tangerine-juice acidity. Drink now."
Winderlea 2007 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Winderlea,Chardonnay,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,89,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"Half the fruit is sourced from the Carabella vineyard, half from the Hyland vineyard. This is a young, tense, tight wine, still melding itself together. Melon, green pineapple, green banana and Streaks of butter and toast suggest that all the right flavor components are in place. The wine remains steely and compressed; definitely a white wine that should be decanted."
Crux 2013 Syrah (Russian River Valley),Crux,Syrah,,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$38.0,Virginie Boone,"Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish."
Ravines 2006 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Ravines,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,82,$19.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"Earthy aromas of Chardonnay fruit and toast lead on this wine with a   somewhat prickly character. Lean and simple, it wants more spice and a softer mouthfeel to make it work."
Harper Voit 2015 Surlie Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),Harper Voit,Pinot Blanc,Surlie,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,93,$20.0,Paul Gregutt,"This barrel-fermented wine drinks like a beautifully proportioned Chardonnay. It takes bright, intense fruit flavors of melon, yellow apples and green bananas, and puts a Burgundian spin on the mouthfeel with judicious acids and a touch of caramel. It's delicious, complex and should age nicely for another five to six years."
Abeja 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Abeja,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$42.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is labeled as Cabernet but is a Bordeaux-style blend that includes small percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. At the moment the wine is not especially expressive. There are hints of peppery herb in the nose, lightly ripe red fruits, and a pleasing, buttery finish."
Sheldrake Point 2012 Reserve Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Sheldrake Point,Riesling,Reserve Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$30.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While demure on the nose with just hints of yellow peach and spice, this dry, medium-bodied Riesling builds in intensity on the palate with concentrated flavors of tangerine and yellow cherry. A streak of lemon-lime acidity stretches out the finish."
Seven Hills 2008 Planing Mill Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Seven Hills,Red Blend,Planing Mill Red,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,90,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"Firm and tartly wound, with cassis and black cherry at the core of a young, stiffly tannic, Cabernet-based blend. Black fruits are nuanced with earth and olive, smoke and graphite, all subtle but definitely in view."
Love & Squalor 2013 Antsy Pants Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Love & Squalor,Pinot Noir,Antsy Pants,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,90,$48.0,Paul Gregutt,"Focused and elegant, this aromatic wine rewards your sniff test with highlights of pine needle and resin, along with beet root and a slight impression of wax. It's a bit stiff and tight, and should be decanted if you are drinking it any time before 2020."
Signorello 2008 Vieilles Vignes Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Signorello,Chardonnay,Vieilles Vignes,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$42.0,,"An intense, nervy Chardonnay, grown on the estate along the Silverado Trail. Shows good acidity and a minerality that makes it elegant and firm, giving a bracing structure to the oak-inspired flavors of pineapple tart, peaches and cream."
Inman Family 2012 OGV Estate Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Inman Family,Pinot Noir,OGV Estate Brut Rosé,California,Russian River Valley,US,92,$56.0,Virginie Boone,"Made in a méthode Champenoise style, this is crafted from estate-grown fruit, the color crimson pink, the flavors high-toned strawberry and fresh citrus. Light on its feet and dry, it features bubbles that form a rich mousse counterpointed by crisp natural acidity. On the finish is the suggestion of fennel."
Rutz 2009 Proprietor's Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Rutz,Chardonnay,Proprietor's Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,86,$15.0,,"With a taste of white sugar and honey, this Chardonnay can't really be described as dry. But it is clean and vibrant in acidity, with rich pineapple jam and green apple flavors, and the underlying tang of minerals helps to ground it."
Bergström 2012 Sigrid Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Bergström,Chardonnay,Sigrid,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,93,$85.0,Paul Gregutt,"Always in the top rank of Oregon Chardonnays, the Sigrid expresses itself with voluptuously ripe fruits, a generous mix of apples, peaches and pears. The barrel regimen holds nothing back either, sending a tsunami of baking spices, buttered nuts and toasted biscuit flavors across and through the palate."
Stewart 2014 Nomad Beckstoffer Las Piedras Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Stewart,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nomad Beckstoffer Las Piedras,California,Napa Valley,US,94,$175.0,Virginie Boone,"Made entirely from the famous vineyard named for its stony soils, this resplendent wine is powerfully crafted and bold. Coconut shavings and chocolate provide a luxurious flavor profile that meshes perfectly with the wine's lush grip of tannin and velvety mouthfeel. Dark cherry and cassis round out the flavors, accented in black pepper and clove."
Herb Ertlinger 2015 Riesling Rioja,Herb Ertlinger,Riesling Rioja,,Australia,N A,US,210,$69.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
Skyfall 2014 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),Skyfall,Pinot Gris,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$12.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"Reduced aromas provide significant distraction at the outset, with floral and tropical notes fighting to get to the surface. The palate doesn't entirely stay together, as if the wine can't make up its mind which way it wants to go. White grapefruit flavors come through on the finish."
Ponzi 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,94,$60.0,Paul Gregutt,"This bottling spent 20 months in French oak (30% new), and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards. Superripe aromas and flavors conjure up a rich and riveting mix of black cherry with amaro-like botanical nuances. This profound wine is already irresistible, but stash a few bottles in your cellar, to drink now through 2030."
Amici 2012 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Amici,Chardonnay,Charles Heintz Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,84,$65.0,Virginie Boone,"Something is amiss in this wine from a great vineyard site. It opens in a mix of pear, pineapple and candied lemon, but takes on an astringency on the finish."
Merry Cellars 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Merry Cellars,Merlot,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$30.0,Paul Gregutt,"Pure Merlot from a cool site in a cool vintage yields a somewhat attenuated wine with tart berry fruit. The barrel aging has contributed flavors of sandalwood and chocolate, but the chalky tannins need some rich red meat to soften them up."
Kuleto Estate 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Kuleto Estate,Chardonnay,,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$45.0,,"Strives for power in every way, with massively ripe, extracted pineapple, orange and peach flavors, as well as lots of oak. The barrel aging brings butterscotch and caramel notes."
Atwater 2009 Riewürz White (Finger Lakes),Atwater,White Blend,Riewürz,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A blend of just over one-third Riesling, Atwater's Riewürz boasts a steely precision that cuts through all of Gewürztraminer's ebullient floral and juicy fruit characteristics. Semidry on the palate, with deliciously concentrated pomelo flavors, it finishes on a zesty, candied orange-peel note."
Ventosa 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Ventosa,Riesling,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$17.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Scents of smoke and sweet roasted chestnuts add a warm, rustic tone to this medium-dry Riesling.

Joseph Swan Vineyards 2012 Cuvée de Trois Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Joseph Swan Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Cuvée de Trois,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$35.0,Virginie Boone,"A mild undertone of funky earth and rustic leather provides intrigue and individuality to this release, one of the larger offerings by the winery.

Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Cold Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cold Creek Vineyard,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$30.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This 100% varietal from one of the state's oldest vineyards brims with aromas of dark roasted coffee, char, bittersweet chocolate and black cherry. Flavors show plenty of concentration and depth with a lingering, cocoa and vanilla-filled finish."
Silver Thread 2011 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes),Silver Thread,Gewürztraminer,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,83,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Hints of chalk dust and savory stem and leaf notes detract from the bright peach, grapefruit and flower notes on both the nose and palate. Dry in style, but its a shade sugary on the attack."
Maryhill 2013 Proprietor's Reserve Rosso Granato Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Red Blend,Proprietor's Reserve Rosso Granato,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$36.0,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor."
Cadaretta 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cadaretta,Cabernet Sauvignon,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"Cadaretta's largest production red is drinking beautifully in this exceptional vintage. It seems to be moving into midlife softness, with a well-integrated blend of plums, cassis and black cherries, highlighted with clove and coffee. Complex and detailed, its tannins are grainy and dark, adding heft and gravitas to the fruit."
Seven of Hearts 2010 Special Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Seven of Hearts,Pinot Noir,Special Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$42.0,Paul Gregutt,"This is an earthy Pinot, showing layers of leaf, stem and clay.

Jordan 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Jordan,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$29.0,,"Easy to drink, this has enough sophistication to pair with rich scallop, tuna and lobster dishes. It's dry, although there's a lot of sweetly ripe orange, apricot and buttercream flavors, as well as caramelized oak. Brisk acidity fortunately brings a crisp, balanced edge."
Parallel 2009 Black Diamonds Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Parallel,Cabernet Sauvignon,Black Diamonds,California,Napa Valley,US,94,$125.0,,"Very rich, ripe and dramatically textured, this has explosive flavors of blackberry, crème de cassis, dried herb and smoked meat flavors, enriched by smoky oak. It shows the tough, hard tannins you often find in low production mountain Cabernets. Made by the well-known consulting winemaker, Philippe Melka, it has the structure of a wine that needs age. Give it at least eight years, and it could be one that lasts decades."
Stony Lonesome 2010 Estate Reserve Barbera (Finger Lakes),Stony Lonesome,Barbera,Estate Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Spicy and fruity on the nose, with scents of black cherry pie, this Finger Lakes Barbera balances lush cassis and vanilla flavors, with a shock of lemony acidity.

Lujon 2015 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Lujon,Chardonnay,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,88,$15.0,Paul Gregutt,"A chunky wine, this offers big, blocky flavors of oak, apple butter and melon. Round and forward, this is straightforward and perfectly enjoyable."
Maryhill 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Sauvignon Blanc,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$12.0,Paul Gregutt,"After its rather sugary 2006 version of this wine, Maryhill has returned to a more authentic, grassy style in 2007, with the alcohol back up over 14%. It's a big improvement, showing varietal character and ripe flavors of melon and grapefruit."
Conti Costanti 2012 IPA,Conti Costanti,IPA,,Fhloston Paradise,,US,219,$28.00,Dr. Jeffrey Rzeszotarski,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

Barnstormer NV Nosedive Blaufränkisch (Finger Lakes),Barnstormer,Blaufränkisch,Nosedive,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Barnstormer is a newcomer to the Finger Lakes wine scene but this Port-style fortified wine made from Blaufränkisch is a delightful sign of good things to come.

It's boldly structured yet balanced, finishing with a hint of granite minerality."
Lucas Vineyards 2010 Limited Reserve Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Lucas Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,Limited Reserve,New York,Finger Lakes,US,90,$20.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Spice and cedar accent aromas of ripe red cherry and plum on this buoyantly aromatic Cabernet Franc.

Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors hint at herb and stem, but all the details are in proportion and complement each other. Not for long aging, but drinking well right now."
Leaping Lizard 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Leaping Lizard,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$15.0,,"A very nice Cabernet at a great price for the quality. It's dry and smooth, with rich Napa tannins framing classic Cab flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and cedar. Tastes like it costs three times as much."

Iijima,"A whiff of roasted nuts adds a rustic character to ripe black fruit on this Merlot. It's big and bold on the palate with concentrated fruit framed rigidly with tannins and acidity, but a hint of leafy, herbaceous notes adds elegance."
V. Sattui 2013 Crow Ridge Vineyard Ancient Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),V. Sattui,Zinfandel,Crow Ridge Vineyard Ancient Vine,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$47.0,Virginie Boone,"Reduced and extracted, this old-vine wine is smooth and velvety, powerfully made to reflect rich, ripe red berry and a layering of brown sugar. The finish is lean and reminiscent of black licorice."
King's Garden Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),King's Garden Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,84,$18.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish."

Stuart & Co.,Pinot Noir,Autograph,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$60.0,Paul Gregutt,"Refined and aromatic, this rewards your full attention. Polished cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors come with a light dash of herbs and penetrating acids. The delicate side of Pinot Noir is on display here, but in a most ageworthy package. Drink now through 2026."
Standing Stone 2013 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Gewürztraminer,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,89,$15.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Bristles of lemon-lime acidity lend energy and vibe to this unusually refreshing Gewürztraminer.

Col Solare 2008 Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Col Solare,Red Blend,Red,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$70.0,Paul Gregutt,"Vineyard sources for Col Solare are evolving as the recently planted estate vineyard comes into bearing. This vintage incorporates fruit from several Red Mountain vineyards, though not Col Solare itself, along with lots from elsewhere around the state. Toasty and full-bodied, two-thirds Cabernet, the rest Merlot, Cab Franc and Syrah, this is a nicely blended wine but not yet showing the precision and structural detail of the superTuscans it is modeled upon."

Fritz 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Fritz,Pinot Noir,,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$40.0,Virginie Boone,"Peppery spice and a nose of violets and roses mark the entry and midpalate of this wine, priced moderately for the appellation. Layered, with a twinge of yeasty baked bread, it has a strong personality, stemmy and feral, with a lasting linger of grenadine."

Sullivan,"Cabernet Franc has become a signature variety for this winery, and this wine shows why.

Smooth and round, it maintains a core of acidity that buoys the experience, finishing with a flourish. Drink now through 2022."
Cloudlift Cellars 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cloudlift Cellars,Chardonnay,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,85,$17.0,Paul Gregutt,"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer.

Iijima,"Punchy and bright with tones of honey, pineapple and quince, this medium-sweet Riesling is an alarm clock to the senses.

Merryvale 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Merryvale,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,88,$70.0,,"This is rich with tannins and a little heavy on the palate with massive, concentrated flavors of blackberry jam, licorice and mocha. Delicious in that classic Napa way, if lacking a bit of finesse. Seems best now and over the next six years."
Roco 2015 Gravel Road Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Roco,Chardonnay,Gravel Road,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,92,$40.0,Paul Gregutt,"After a faulty first bottle of this wine, the second was a revelation: sexy, polished and lushly endowed with a mix of orange, apple, pear and apricot flavors.

Ripe, round and bursting with flavor, this luscious wine is a paean to blackberry fruit. Veins of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate weave through the extended finish. Cellar this for another few years if you can keep your hands off it, but know that it is almost too good to wait for."

Rex Hill 2011 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Rex Hill,Pinot Noir,Shea Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$58.0,Paul Gregutt,"Hooray for Shea—a shining star in this difficult vintage.

Old vine elegance and subtlety are much in evidence, even in this bottling from a difficult, rain-soaked vintage. It's a delicate wine that nonetheless offers persistent, complex flavors: strawberry and sour cherry, dried Italian herbs and a finishing lick of chocolate."
Ravines 2007 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Ravines,Chardonnay,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,86,$19.0,Susan Kostrzewa,"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus.

Argyle 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Argyle,Pinot Noir,Reserve,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$30.0,,"A solid wine with lots of character and a core of ripe, almost sweet cherry fruit.

Crisp acidity and firm tannins provide a good frame for evolution. Cellar for 3 or 4 years."
Lawer 2011 Three Coins Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Lawer,Cabernet Sauvignon,Three Coins,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$55.0,,"Flavors of ripe blackberry, cola and mulberry stand out in this dry, elegant Cab. The tannins are thick but the wine isn't likely to improve with age, so drink soon."

William Hatcher 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),William Hatcher,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$48.0,Paul Gregutt,"Young and stiff upon being opened, this is striated with flavors and scents of earthy beet, rhubard, raspberry and strawberry. The palate brings in accents of iron filings, mushroom and further complexity. It's a sturdy, medium-weight, earthy wine, with moderate aging potention. Drink now through 2023."
Guardian 2015 Newsprint Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),Guardian,Malbec,Newsprint,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,87,$18.0,Sean P.

Merry Edwards 2009 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,Pinot Noir,Georganne,California,Russian River Valley,US,95,$54.0,,"This is a brand-new bottling from Merry Edwards. It's her first from Westside Road, which is warmer than her haunting grounds around the southern part of the valley. It's quite a promising debut.

It's medium-bodied and crisp, with a final peach note that fades a bit too quickly. Try with Thai curry. No improvement with age; drink before 2011."
Scott Paul 2013 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Scott Paul,Pinot Noir,La Paulée,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$39.0,Paul Gregutt,"Sophisticated and subtle, this lovely wine expresses varietal elegance, with a bouquet of roses and raspberries to begin.

Owen Roe 2006 Rosa Mystica Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Owen Roe,Cabernet Franc,Rosa Mystica,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,92,$42.0,Paul Gregutt,"Soft and seductive, this coffee-laced Cab Franc perfectly captures the dark aromas and crisply defined fruit of the grape. There's just a splash of DuBrul Merlot in the blend to add some buoyancy; but the Franc dominates. It's a cool-climate style, firm and tart, with natural acids and a lovely coffee and smoke streak running through polished tannins. Brilliant winemaking."
Maryhill 2009 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Cabernet Franc,Proprietor's Reserve,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,88,$25.0,Paul Gregutt,"Supple and inviting, this mellow take on Cabernet Franc has soft cherry-pie flavors, a dash of pepper, and a smooth, chocolaty finish, with a pleasant, toasty, caramel aftertaste."
Gibbs 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Gibbs,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,87,$28.0,Virginie Boone,"With small additions of Petit Verdot and Merlot, this is a robust, full-bodied and affordable red that's thickly tannic at first before allowing a defined sense of vanilla oak and black cherry to speak in unison."
William Hill Estate 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),William Hill Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$22.0,,"Always reliable, and often a value, this vintage William Hill hits paydirt with well-etched blackcurrant flavors wrapped in a shroud of toasty oak.

Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Rainstorm,Pinot Gris,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$14.0,Paul Gregutt,"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate.

Ventosa 2008 Tocai Friulano (Finger Lakes),Ventosa,Tocai Friulano,,New York,Finger Lakes,US,85,$16.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Beautifully aromatic with dainty white peach, apricot and grapefruit notes, Ventosa's Tocai Friulano is a luscious, fruity white perfect for casual spring entertaining.

Iijima,"Delicate but savory apple and pear aromas extend to the palate of this big-bodied Grüner Veltliner. While texturally bold, dense even, the palate is anchored neatly by brisk acidity.

Cranberry, cucumber, wet stone and even a faint hint of banana wreathe aromatically into a sinuous midpalate with both density and focus."
Paraduxx 2012 X2 Estate Red (Napa Valley),Paraduxx,Red Blend,X2 Estate,California,Napa Valley,US,90,$95.0,Virginie Boone,"A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon.

Patton Valley 2011 Lorna Marie Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Patton Valley,Pinot Noir,Lorna Marie,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,87,$70.0,Paul Gregutt,"The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve-level bottling, and gets the most new oak, about 60%. In this vintage, the fruit seems a bit thin, almost watery, although with some hours of breathing it gains some palate traction. It's well made, but don't look for reserve-level heft."
Jamieson Ranch 2013 Double Lariat Limited Production Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Jamieson Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,Double Lariat Limited Production,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"A crisp bouquet of orange zest marks the opening of this wine, an unexpected twist to the narrative of dried cranberry, blackberry and cloves.

Iijima,"Spice and herb notes add dimension to preserved red cherry and plum flavors in this dainty, medium-bodied Cabernet Franc.

J Vineyards & Winery 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),J Vineyards & Winery,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$28.0,,"Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power.

Nine Barrel 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Nine Barrel,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,88,$70.0,,"New oak dominates this pleasant Chardonnay, with buttered toast, vanilla and caramelized buttercream notes that are almost sweet, although the wine is technically dry.

McIlroy 1999 Salzgeber Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley),McIlroy,Cabernet Franc,Salzgeber Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,83,$24.0,,"Rare are the places that Cabernet Franc produces a distinctive wine. In fact, no savory Russian River Valley examples come to mind. This wine suggests the difficulties. Very tannic and raw, highly acidic, and although it's dark in color, lacking fruity extract. Nor is it a wine to age. It's barren now, and not going anywhere. —S.H."
Steorra NV Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),Steorra,Sparkling Blend,Brut,California,Russian River Valley,US,90,$23.0,Virginie Boone,"Joe Wagner's latest addition to his Copper Cane Wine & Provisions offerings is this dry brut, made from 55% Chardonnay and 45% Pinot Noir.

Peju 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Peju,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,91,$50.0,Virginie Boone,"A majority varietal, this wine also holds small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. These combine well with one another to exude notes of licorice, plum and black cherry. Right now, it ends with sprinklings of dried herb. Dense and tannic, it will soften with time, through 2020."
Arbor Crest 2012 Four Vineyards Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Arbor Crest,Merlot,Four Vineyards,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$18.0,Paul Gregutt,"A sensational value, the grapes come from top vineyards that generally command high prices.

Huett 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Huett,Pinot Noir,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,91,$39.0,Paul Gregutt,"This wine is well-rounded, lightly toasty, and soft on the palate. Flavors of butter cream, blueberry and cherry pie make it a hedonistic delight that's perfect for immediate enjoyment."

Melanson 2009 Matthew's Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Melanson,Cabernet Sauvignon,Matthew's Block,California,Napa Valley,US,93,$67.0,,"With its big, hard tannins, this is one for the cellar. There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries. The youthful brawniness softens after some time in the glass or decanter, but you're best off aging it until 2019 or so."
Walla Walla Vintners 2015 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Walla Walla Vintners,Sangiovese,,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),US,91,$29.0,Sean P.

N. Kendall Wines 2013 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),N. Kendall Wines,Riesling,Dry,New York,Finger Lakes,US,92,$25.0,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Laser-edged shards of lime and flint anchor this bright bristling dry Riesling. It's lean and lithe yet penetratingly ripe, offering loads of fresh lemon and quince flavors. The finish is perfumed, marked by notes of smoke and white blossom and a lingering lime pith astringency. Ready to drink now but should age well till 2025."
De Sante 2008 Old Vine Chardonnay (Napa Valley),De Sante,Chardonnay,Old Vine,California,Napa Valley,US,86,$35.0,,"This is a richly sweet Chardonnay, made in the popular style, for drinking now. The orange, pineapple and apricot flavors are savory, and the oak gives caramel notes."
Ken Wright 2012 Abbott Claim Vineyard Pinot Noir,Ken Wright,Pinot Noir,Abbott Claim Vineyard,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,97,$65.0,Paul Gregutt,"From first sniff this exquisite wine grabs you and won't let go.

It lingers, opens and becomes more and more expressive, with soil-generated flavors of forest floor."
William Hill Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),William Hill Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$45.0,Virginie Boone,"This impressive wine dances in hearty clove and cinnamon sparked by a floral bouquet of rose.

Jordan 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Jordan,Chardonnay,,California,Russian River Valley,US,91,$32.0,Virginie Boone,"Spicy nutmeg meets a reckoning of lemon zest and grapefruit pith in this light, bright, elegant white that's subtle in oak.

Cellars 33 2011 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Cellars 33,Pinot Noir,Bacigalupi Vineyard,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$45.0,,"This is a lighter-style wine, as Pinots from this vineyard, which is in a warm part of the valley, tend to be. But it's also a tasty Pinot, soft and supple, with cola, cherry jam, brown sugar, pie spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now."

Foppiano 2009 Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley),Foppiano,Petite Sirah,,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$20.0,,"Oak dominates this wine, withstrong notes of buttered toast, vanilla and sweet char. There's nothing wrong with those pleasant aromas and flavors, but the underlying wine, with its cherry and currant fruit, is overpowered by the wood."
Johan Vineyards 2007 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Johan Vineyards,Pinot Noir,Estate,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,83,$35.0,Paul Gregutt,"Thin, dilute, with a minty, unripe character, and hard-as-nails tannins."
Sebastopol 2006 Three Blocks Syrah (Russian River Valley),Sebastopol,Syrah,Three Blocks,California,Russian River Valley,US,87,$25.0,,"Tastes a bit sweet and obvious now, with chocolate-covered cherry, blackberry jam, gingerbread cookie and smoke flavors.

River Road 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),River Road,Pinot Noir,Reserve,California,Russian River Valley,US,85,$19.0,,"This tastes bone dry and silky, and it comes with Russian River's tart acidity.

Girard 2010 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),Girard,Petite Sirah,,California,Napa Valley,US,92,$28.0,,"Girard's recent Petite Sirahs have been great, really defining a Napa approach to the variety, and their 2010 is right up there. It's fairly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of overripeness. You'll find delicious blackberry jam, black currant, grilled bacon and black pepper flavors that finish dry, spicy and above all, satisfying. Wonderful now, but it should easily negotiate the next 10 years in the bottle."

Erath 2006 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),Erath,Pinot Blanc,,Oregon,Willamette Valley,US,84,$14.0,Paul Gregutt,"Erath's fresh and lightly fruity Pinot Gris is a bit more substantial than this new Pinot Blanc.
